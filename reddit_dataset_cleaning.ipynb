      " 'There really isn’t a more idiotic devolution of a character in modern popular culture than that of Rambo. If you haven’t seen the first film, First Blood, it’s a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn’t a psychotic nationalist, he’s a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He’s a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It’s not even an action film, it’s a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn’t Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were.\\n\\nThen, in the second film, we get a neck shattering 180 into full on Ronald Reagan revisionism of the war in Vietnam. Rambo 2 perpetuates several popular and resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war and that the war would have been won by Americans of only we (the American people) had allowed them to win.\\n\\nTo say Rambo 2 is cultural vandalism would be putting it mildly. It’s a cinematic tragedy. They took a poignant anti war film and made it into a jingoistic Cold War fantasy.'\n",

      "I knew I was going to like it because P5 is my fav game and I really enjoy rhythm games. The game is overhyped to the moon, thing happened to me playing Nier Automata, I expected it to be perfect and I hated many things like pacing and how it wasted your time but it still leaves a lot to interpret.\\n\\nNow for Expedition 33, you can see it's not a perfect game in the first hour by the exploration or gameplay outside fights and cinematics but it doesn't waste your time, the pacing is really fast, maybe too fast jumping from one place to another. \\n\\nAbout the gameplay, I see the limitations in doing repetitive things, getting your skill rotation just right without having to heal, but I also see the insane potential with finding Pictos, leveling up certain skills that are insane, for example:\\n\\nI come from Persona where you can hyper buff someone (+Atk, passives to deal +75% damage, double damage ability, less defense on enemy, weaknesses, severe magic damage or physical multi-hits)\\n\\nAnd now on this game you tell me I can stack up Virtuous Stance 200% dmg, inverse that doubles damage, First strike extra damage, Immolate: not being hit extra damage, +15% from powerful, greater defenseless on enemy, and Maelle 9cost skill multi-hits but damage crits deal double damage, and then Sciel can double that damage too, I was able to deal 250k damage in one hit on my first playthrough damn, I didn't even grind or go out of my way to explore other places, I just spent too much time thinking stuff.\\n\\nPlaying on Extreme the game asks for almost perfection, dying in 1-4 hits you have to learn the timings for parries, I love rhythm games and this is kinda like that.\\n\\nAs for the story its super confusing until the end, but I respect the ballsy move, and they wanted to tell a story of grief and loss and also explain the science fiction in an emotional way, and this is the way. Emotional science fiction is the way, that's what I love about og Sephiroth compared to newer one in remakes, emotionally grounded science fiction.\\n\\nThe music was alright sometimes and others it was absolutely perfect and insane. At times playing I was very bored and played a bit and then continued, or because it was really tough and I had to concentrate, but it was still a worthwhile special experience.    1\n",
      "I've read that Kojima has found appreciation for his newest game to be unsettling, as it is a sign of becoming too mainstream. I'll assume it's as unconventional of the mind itself, and this leads me to believe perhaps it is actually a sign of changing tides. Maybe the game is just as out there, but the world and at least the community are becoming more flexible. More eccentric trends finding niche places in so many hearts is a beautiful thing to me. I support the creatives and odd thinkers. I think this current era is very accepting of them. More speak out and break norms as they realize it is safe, and even somewhat normal to be a crazy, messed up snowflake.
