Take a bow, Arthur Rinderknech.

funny,1lyu9bb,Another ‘stupid Dad thing’,"I posted about something I called ‘stupid Dad thing’ and got some likes so I’ll post another.  Here’s the original https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/s/ZpkXbdfHpx

We always had 2 vehicles.  My wife had a minivan and I had a car that I commute in.  Well I bought a new car and didn’t trade anything so we had 3 vehicles for a short period of time   

It was a really nice day in the late Fall and I decided to wash all the vehicles.  We had a parking lot next to our house which was for public parking to a conservation area.  I parked my wife’s minivan in that lot right in front of a boulder.  They had boulders around the parking lot to keep cars off the grass.  I also parked my new car there after washing it.  My wife called out that it was dinner time.  I asked her to come drive her van so I could drive my car and save a few minutes.  She walked over and jumped in the drivers seat and I watched her drop the transmission into drive and proceed to drive into the boulder and mount it and trash the front end of the van ( which was pristine and 2 weeks away from ending the lease).   She felt bad and although I was pissed about it I didn’t say anything like ‘how the hell did you not see that big boulder in front of you?’   I wanted to, but I resisted.  

An hour later she asked me to go pickup our son from work.  It was now pitch black outside.   I backed my new car out of the garage and smashed into my old car that was parked exactly where I always backed out to.   So I dinged up my back bumper on my new car and put a pretty serious large dent in the side of the old car that I was planning to sell.  

So in the span of an hour, all three of our vehicles were involved in accidents that were all our fault and basically in our driveway.   I say ‘our fault’ but in fairness I parked the cab right in front of the boulder and my wife couldn’t see it so essentially all three accidents were my fault.  

Can laugh about it now but it wasn’t amusing at the time.  ",9,3,1752417197.0,,0.57,True,False,Ancient-Witness-615,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1lyu9bb/another_stupid_dad_thing/,new,low

funny,1lx6vdj,Traveling lasagna,"Not sure this story belongs here but something I just read reminded me of it and I thought I’d share.  Lived in NJ and one very cold January my wife made a ton of food and we ran out of room in the fridges.  Since it was cold, I was already keeping some things like beer and pies out in the garage.  It was so cold things were freezing. 

 Well I had a large  pan of lasagna that was baked and needed to be kept cold.   Not sure why I did this but I put it on the roof of a minivan that we had at the time.  I completely forgot about that and I guess we had so much food we didn’t miss that large pan.  I drove that van to work all week on various interstate highways at 75 mph.  The following Saturday I asked my wife what we were having for dinner and she said ‘the lasagna you have out in the garage’.  Thats when I remembered putting it on the roof.   I cringed thinking that it likely flew off the roof and could have done some serious damage to someone on the highway.  I went out to the garage and lo and behold it was still on the roof, kind of jammed in under the roof rail.  So I grabbed it and never admitted my stupid mistake until after we ate it.  I figured my wife would fight with me over the safety of eating it after what it had been through but honestly it was the best lasagna ever.  Thats one of our now famous ‘stupid Dad moves’ that we joke about",48,5,1752240387.0,,0.78,True,False,Ancient-Witness-615,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1lx6vdj/traveling_lasagna/,new,low

gaming,1lzhxo7,Looking for a wholesome game (PS5 or PC) that makes the loss of our dog more bearable to my wife.,"Long story short, a few days ago we lost one of our dogs due to a disease. My wife is devastated. He was our ""special"" dog because he was the first we got as a couple, when he was a little puppy. We've been trying different ways to heal, and I thought maybe a comforting game might help her cope with the grief, even just a little.

She’s not a hardcore gamer but really appreciates emotional depth, some relaxing (or analytic) gameplay, and beautiful landscapes. Maybe a meaningful story or cozy atmosphere.

Whether it’s something heartwarming, visually stunning (she doesn't like 2D games), or just a peaceful escape from reality, I’d love to find a game where she can feel a little lighter. I was thinking about Red Dead Online (private server thanks to the 850 trick on PS5) or similar.

gaming,1lzekul,Having 30-45 minute long sections where you are unable to save is bad game design,"As said in the title. Having 30-45 minute long sections where you are unable to save is bad game design, and even worse is when games don't let you save wherever or whenever you want.
 
I'm aware that it's a ""gameplay reason"" or whatever other bullshit you want to say, but being unable to save for extreme stretches of time is the most backwards ass thing in gaming. Being completely unable to, say, load a game up and play for 15 minutes and then save wherever you are should be in 99% of games.

And no, I'm not a fucking dumbass, I know why some games can't let you save wherever you want, but I'm not talking about Dead Space or Resident Evil or whatever else does it. I'm talking about RPG games where there's no damn excuse other than the devs didn't want to put it in. If there is a legitimate reason why it's not possible, please tell me, because Pokémon has been doing it since the first fucking game and they rarely have problems with saving as far as I've experienced. Almost every Dragon Quest game I've ever played let's me save wherever, and if I can't save there it tells me and I know to leave or finish that portion before I'm allowed again.",1595,442,1752472304.0,,0.87,True,False,ExactInvestment1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lzekul/having_3045_minute_long_sections_where_you_are/,new,medium

gaming,1lz74a6,As someone who played Battle Royale games religiously for years but haven't in a few years and recently tried them again... I think Battle Royales might be an awful genre.,"I always loved Battle Royale games. I played PUBG when it came out and it was my only game 6+ hours a day every day for over a year. I played Apex Legends for a year, nearly all my time going to it. After trying Apex again recently... I think Battle Royale might just be a bad genre.

The gameplay loop has become so predictable it's almost depressing. Everyone does their damnest to drop away from anyone else. So now you spend five to ten minutes looting and wandering.

gaming,1lz6quh,Graphics should go backwards from now on,"I think we got to a point where AAA game development might not be sustainable anymore. 8 years to develop a video game is stupid, especially for all the artists involved. If you joined the industry recently, if you are lucky you will release maybe 3-4 video games I think ? 

Technicals expectations on AAA games are ridiculous. 

I am going to be extreme but just imagine if for exemple the next Elder Scrolls game would release with Morrowind Graphics with some improvements like the render distance and dynamic shadows. The time of development would be reduced so much, same for development costs. And it would be very rewarding and fulfilling for a developer and artist to be able to work on many games. 

QoL, development tools, technical limitations have improved so much. I personally think that graphics peaked in early 2000 with games such as Star Wars KOTOR, Final Fantasy X, Morrowind, Deus Ex… No modern games gave me the same feel as wandering on Dantooine in KOTOR. And no, I didn’t experienced those games when they were out, I don’t have any nostalgia. I played them in the last 10 years.

Imagine those games with today’s standards in QoL and some game design. Keep those polygons low and those textures at 512x512, and improve on everything else. So much resource spent on 50k polygons characters with 10 materials, grass simulation, realtime water and fluids simulation … and optimisation of all this fancy stuff.

gaming,1lz39ku,Clair Obscur Expedition 33 doesn't hook me and I feel crazy (no spoilers),"Seeing the discourse online I feel like I've taken crazy pills. The first impression Clair Obscur has given me when I play the game for myself doesn't nearly match how everyone else describes it. I'm fully aware this is a subjective topic and that tastes differ, but what makes me feel crazy is that I simply can't understand what everyone else is talking about when they sing their praises.
 
Granted, I haven't played more than a few hours, because I can't force myself to play it any further. So many people have said, however, that the game hooks you immediately and that the introduction alone is nothing short of incredible.
 
Another thing to bear in mind is that I'm not very experienced with modern turn based combat. But does that even matter when so many who say they normally don't care about turn based combat RPG games already claim it to be game of the year?

Here are some of my thoughts, based on just a few hours of the game (no spoilers):
 
* The game, while dressed in pretty graphics, feels pretty unpolished. Among the first things happening in the game is that one of your companions talks to you while speeding ahead like The Flash. They're talking casually while a couple hundred metres away from each other. There are invisible walls placed awkwardly which reminds me of several generations older games. The jumping animations look stiff. There's basically no animation for switching characters. And so on.

* That emotional moment everyone's praising is not nearly as impactful to me. I don't know, I don't think there was enough build up for me to care, not enough to the characters. It also doesn't help that some in game reactions to the event immediately after felt weird to me.

* What also made me not care about the emotional moment is the lacking facial animations and voice acting. Sure, there are lots of games in the 2D or 2,5D genre that manages to give feelings despite the lack of both, but a game that sets out to be this high fidelity, 3rd person game needs to do better in that department. Many faces while talking remind me of those in Horizon Zero Dawn before the remaster (which everyone complained about). The voice acting mostly ranges from wooden to annoyingly exaggerated (some sound like Oscar Isaacs' attempt at British in the Moon Knight show) and reminds me in some ways to old movie license games.
 
* The timing of the dodge/parry mechanic in combat is way too unforgiving and the enemy animations remind me of those in the Soulslike games (a genre which also often is overhyped imo). If I wanted to play a game with such emphasis in timing during combat I'd rather play a character action game or a fighting game with much better flow. I go to turn based combat for strategic depth more than anything else. These mechanics, or rather the way they're implemented, don't add anything of value to me but rather frustration.
 
* The game simply looks odd to me. I think my problem is the lighting and bloom being so upscaled. 
 
* It's weird to me how the main character is such a blatant clone of Robert Pattinson (who's very popular now and seen everywhere already), without them going the Kojima route and actually hiring him. Since they hired Charlie Cox, why not model the character after him instead?
 
To me, it feels like being the target of a flash mob where everyone just decided to overhype this game to prank me, lol. And I'm not one of those contrarian guys normally. Most of my favourite games are universally praised. I just can't get this one. I know I'll be massively downvoted for having this opinion, but at least it feels good to get this off my chest haha!

We're all on Xbox, the game is on Game Pass, were all using 1gb wired internet connections, should be an easy win.

Nope, I host the game, one kid joins, other one can't. We restart, no one can join. 

We Google, we search, we try all different things. For some reason this game takes a fucking eternity to load on an Xbox One X. So restarting it either to try and make something work or when it crashes takes ages. 

Maybe we need to complete the tutorial mission? Maybe we need to sign up for a Shift account?

All three of us sign up for Shift accounts, we start the game, hurrah! It works. 

For ten minutes, then the kids start crashing out to the Xbox home screen. They can't rejoin. We unlink our Shift accounts, we relink or Shift accounts, it doesn't work.

We load the characters into an offline mode before trying to join, it doesn't work, crashes to home screen, wait eternity to load again. Shift account not logged into, can't join. 

It just went on and on, I've TL:DR'd the whole thing because it's just a boring, frustrating nightmare to detail it all. 

Eight hours we've been trying to get it to work and we've played the actual game for about half an hour.

We've all uninstalled it and requested our Shite/Shift accounts be deleted.

gaming,1lycff9,Something I've been thinking about recently. Has there ever been a T rated game where blood stains environments during combat?,"Reposting because I forgot you can't attach images to discussion posts, and the old one got taken down:

So, in general, the ESRB seems to be pretty consistent with what type of content earns a game what kind of rating. Every game I can think of which shows blood staining environments during combat has had an M rating. There are T rated games with blood splashes during combat, but they always seem to just evaporate into the air.

I bring this up because the original Oblivion actually released with a T rating from the ESRB, only to be later re-rated to M after the discovery of some nudity in the game's files. In the ESRB's statement about the re-rating, they did also say that Bethesda had mislead them as to how violent the game really was, so it would have likely been rated M had they known everything it contained anyway. But, that statement was mainly in regards to one specific mutilated corpse in the game, not about the game's standard combat experience; leaving open the possibility that the game's use of blood staining environments would have still been okay for the T rating.

The only games I can think of which kept their T ratings and had anything similar to this were Halo 5 and Halo Infinite, where small amounts of non-red alien blood can appear on the ground if you keep shooting a dead enemy, but that's about it.

gaming,1ly7161,No brainer mechanics that somehow haven't been implemented.,"Il start. A ""shock and awe"" system.  

Now, many games have some sort of fear based mechanic that can make enemies flee in terror based on certain skill checks or abilities, or you can ""hold triangle to brutalise enemy"" and the like.

But in almost every game this applies too, you can be fighting over 50 enemies, flawlessly and horrifically dispatch 40 of them without any issues, and the last ten will still be raving about how screwed you are as they line up for the meat grinder.

I personally would love to see a mechanic where they react to you being a demon, or having the reputation for such.

So Il start with kingdom come deliverance 2 (cause that's what I'm playing at the moment) 15 dudes come at me, I demolish 13 of them, the last 2 should see this and immediately flee for their lives right? Nope they holler about how I am for sure gonna lose and keep coming.

Or in Skyrim, end game, I am the master of several guilds, possibly a vampire lord or werewolf, have tussled with demons and gods, killed hoards of dragons and their god/demon thing, why the hell is some street hoodlum picking a fight with me?

Any thoughts? Or any other mechanics that you think might be no brainers?

Edit: so this is apparently super divisive, either it's a really dumb mechanic no one wants, or it's a really good mechanic that should be in more games. It was really more of a half baked shower thought, but I'm glad to see some other mechanics being brought up like universal controller remapping that one is honestly the real no brainer tbh",2671,605,1752343808.0,,0.92,True,False,eeeeeeeeEeeEEeeeE6,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ly7161/no_brainer_mechanics_that_somehow_havent_been/,new,medium

And I still struggle with this issue but it's been a LITTLE better.  What helped was choosing shorter games and games that have been on my bucket list forever. Go figure it's always been DOOM.  I'll be 40 in a few days so I'm pretty old and have been wanting to complete DOOM since I was a child.  I got pretty far, took a break cause I wanted something more modern and ended up finally booting up...DOOM 2016 lol.  Also has been on my bucket list since release as I've been a Doom fan since I was like 10.  Completed it, went back to DOOM og, beat it.  And now I want to play DOOM II and Eternal side to side. But I also play subnautica on and off and I've noticed trying to juggle more than like 2 games makes it difficult to sustain interest in all three and you kind of fumble around with them all til you stop playing any of them.  So it's good to focus on like one meat meatier game, and like a small side game, at least for me.

2. No power fantasy, where you're never really equipped to face the threat (Amnesia, Outlast).

gaming,1lxbnwe,Zombie logic. Video Game versus Movie.,"Hey everyone,

I've been thinking about the disconnect between zombie movies and zombie games. In most films, the horror comes from survival and desperation. It’s about narrowly escaping a horde, the constant tension of being hunted, and the feeling that you're just one wrong move away from being overwhelmed. The zombies are a force of nature, and the main goal is to just get away.

But in most games, we're basically zombie-slaying superheroes. It becomes less about survival and more about mowing down waves of them.

So it got me wondering: could a game where the primary mechanic is *running and escaping* actually be fun? Or does that kind of helpless desperation only work when you're watching it on a screen, not when you're the one holding the controller?

Are people still into this type of mode? Titanfall 2 multi did it right where there's cannon fodder and grunts to kill if you're not skilled enough to kill other players and still made you feel like you're contributing. 

Would a new IP succeed with this? Or would it require some vetting, like needing Tom Clancy as part of the title banner to succeed?

gaming,1lwkzu5,KRAFTON responds,"To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,

—  Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves

First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.

Background of Leadership Change

KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.

Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.

However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.

KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.

The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.

We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.

KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team

To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.

KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees

Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.

Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.

Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.",913,432,1752173860.0,,0.87,True,False,doge1976,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lwkzu5/krafton_responds/,new,medium

I played >!Mexico!< w/ share Everything turned on and it felt cluttered & too easy by the end. 

Signs & structures everywhere.

When I first got to >!Australia!<, first thing I did was skip the ship and circle the map clockwise on foot, which was a grand and difficult 10 hour journey.

No structures or signs made for some amazing views. Made it feel more post apocalyptic.

Inspired me to turn on the share Only Some option and it feels a lot better for me. 

I’ve found it a good compromise between completely offline, and everything turned on.

Your structures still show up in others worlds, so you still get likes. It doesn’t work retroactively, however. 

Whatever is in your world when you turn it on, it will stay there unless you remove it.

Other peoples paths, cairns and mushrooms will still show up in your world, so you still have the option to give likes to others.

This option makes it more difficult as everything has to be built by you. You have to be strategic in structure placement and bandwidth usage.

Roads still appear built by others, but building them off network first, before connecting regions, will give you credit. 

I would highly recommend this option for anyone else who wishes to avoid structure bloat & sign spam.

I personally have three I think are *very good*, but not necessarily top tier.

1. House Beneviento from Resident Evil Village - I know most would probably rate Castle Dimitrescu higher, but the sudden shift to more puzzle-based gameplay and the dichotomy between the more mundane house and the horrific creature(s) within really stuck out in my mind.

2. Ashtray Maze from Control - A mindbending power fantasy in the best sense, all set to heavy rock. A highlight. 

3. The Halligtree from Elden Ring - The best overall legacy dungeon in the game in my opinion, with an interesting descent that starts in the top of the branches and spirals down and down until you get to the cavernous interior, and ends in the meme-worthy Malenia, blade of Miquella.

gaming,1lv0j0j,Xbox layoffs,"I just wanted to see what everyone's opinions are on the recent Xbox layoffs.  It's a complex issue with countless people involved and I hope anyone laid off finds themselves with a new job soon.  My big problem with it I guess is that some of the layoffs make sense from a business perspective.  I'm sad to say it but the Rare job cuts do make sense to a degree.  They haven't produced anything really commercially viable besides Sea of Thieves that actually made the hefty purchase worth it from a purely business perspective.  Everwild looked kind of cool but obviously it lacked a stable core and it just never found its footing.  I agree with a lot of the moves they are making, like shifting Halo to Unreal engine for the future.  On the other hand it's kind of insane that they got rid of Tango and had cuts at Turn 10.  Forza was doing well and while Hifi Rush was a little bit niche but if you can keep the budget in check and not expect Call of Duty numbers, I think it was great.  

The biggest upset for me was the Perfect Dark cancellation, it seemed to be nearing the finish line in a year or two and had numerous teams pulled in for help.  I know everyone hates when artistic expression is stamped out by business but I understand why MS finally had to cut their losses on Everwild for sure.  They have so many good franchises to work with and I hope they turn things around with a happy medium of artists being happy and the shareholders being happy with the profits.

I'm sure it boils down to management at the end of the day and I hope that everyone can find that happy middle ground.  As a gamer I try to do my part and talk with my money and I urge everyone to do that same.  I bought Clair Obscur day one after seeing the reviews because that's what I want to see more of, and I refuse to buy into free to play with micro transactions because I don't like the idea.

gaming,1lul1cn,Does there exist a game with this specific gameplay loop?,"Hi.

I'm curious whether there is a game like this:

An adventure / action / RPG game where you explore the world, gathering resources along the way, which then goes into a management sim where you spend the resources to build a city or home base



Here are some examples of games I've played that come close to this idea but don't quite fit:

- Little King's Story
- Suikoden
- Harvestella 
- Ys 8 Lacrimosa of Dana
- Zelda Breath of the Wild (Tarrey Town sidequest)
- Xenoblade Chronicles (Colony 6 sidequest)
- Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven (Avalon city)


However, all of these games aren't quite it - it's not so much a town-building game as it is just a town upgrading system. You don't tend to be able to choose where each new building goes, it just happens in a linear sequence. When you ""max out"" the town upgrades, the final town will look exactly the same as a maxed-out town of every other player on every other playthrough. So there isn't much freedom of expression in the town building.


Here are some games that come even closer to the idea:

- Dragon Quest Builders / Builders 2

It isn't so much a management sim as it is a Minecraft style block-by-block building game. The game does recognise specific rooms depending on which objects you place in them, though, which is fun.
However the issue comes with the fact that, in these games, your home base is only recognised within a tiny 32x32 square of land, and anything you build outside of that ""doesn't count"". There does exist the larger sandbox mode, but there isn't much sim gameplay there, it's mostly a pure sandbox at that point. 


- ActRaiser

This game _does_ feature both action levels and sim levels, however the two don't really interact with each other that much. The only resource you gain in the action levels is score, which has a vague effect on your eventual maximum population in the sim levels, but the correlation isn't really obvious. Plus you can't replay the action levels, so there isn't really a ""gameplay loop"" of gathering -> building -> gathering etc.

The sim system in ActRaiser is extremely basic - even though you get to ""decide"" which direction your town builds in, there really isn't all that much choice at the end of the day - you will want to max out the town by just telling them to build on all available tiles... and, again, all players' endgame towns will end up looking identical to each other. It doesn't quite have the depth I'm looking for.

Thanks guys, I'll be checking some of these out.

\-

Specifically I'm looking for shooters, but any game that fits the criteria is good.

I'm talking about weight gameplay-wise, so killing another person actually feels like a challenge. Too many games, even those that pride themselves on their realism and grittiness, have you slaying hordes and hordes of enemies, so by the end your character racks up a triple digit kill-count. Even games universally loved, like Red Dead Redemption 2, have an unrealistic amount of enemies and superhuman main characters. Every shootout ends up with thirty bodies.

I want a game where the shootouts feel just as challenging, but the amount of bodies laying on the ground at the end of a gunfight is like, 3 or 4, not 40. Smart, accurate AI, and players have just as little health as the enemies, so running and gunning is a total no-go, you have to actually plan out your engagements.

I know there are games with elements like this, or where these are true to certain extents, but there are always just so many enemies to kill anyway.

Compared to renting where its the blatent understanding you do not have full ownership over the item one exchanged currency for. 

I again understand that one is buying the license buts let's be real anybody buying any type of license for a product is basically renting thr product for a 1 time fee or a recurring fee are are not buying anything but rather renting. 

Im just advocating for the verbatim to be changed so consumers clearly understand what they are purchasing beyond reading an EULA( which let's be honest the majority of the world population does not read those, not saying thats a good thing just pointing out a fact, and advocating for consumer protection that makes it clear one isnt buying the product is a positive)

gaming,1lu3qfk,Modest proposal for the age of digital gaming: legal rights of game owners,"Many gamers disdain ""pure digital"" games and want physical media. This is understandable as a sense of security and liberty comes with that (the company can't remove the cart from my hands; I can resell it if I want or gift to my kids). But this is untenable as we go into the future.. physical media just doesn't make sense as game balloon in size and are increasingly online-enabled or dependent on regular updates for bug fixes and content.

The real problem is not the medium of physical vs. digital. After all, today, thanks to the internet and related tech, we have far greater access to ancient games than ever before. The problem is the industry and legal status quo is essentially that no protected rights existing for gamers at all, beyond what a publisher feels like offering- which is generally nothing and summarized as ""you gave us $70 so we, of the kindness of our hearts, chose to let you play for a while; but now we decided you can't.""

**Proposal**: When a consumer purchases a digital version of a game, they have legal right to possess and use that game in perpetuity. If the publisher ceases to make the game available for download on its servers by purchasers or ceases operations, that game may be retained by purchasers and legally shared with other purchasers. If the game is online-only and depends on a dedicated server AND the publisher ends its online services for the game, then it becomes legally permissible for third parties to host such servers without permission needed. At the same time, the publisher is absolved of all responsibilities associated with running such a server (security, bugs, etc.) and the third party is ""on their own"".  This should be federal law, not something the publisher has any choice about. 

The benefits of such law is that games do not disappear from history, consumers are able to own products they bought, and there is no undue burden on developers to infinitely support servers that become financially unviable.",0,32,1751917041.0,,0.44,True,False,bad_apiarist,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lu3qfk/modest_proposal_for_the_age_of_digital_gaming/,new,low
gaming,1lu3534,Could we also get some huge initiative about games being released in a poor state?,"With all the attention Stop Killing Games is getting I feel like this would also be a good time to bring up games being released in a “half-assed” state. We’ve seen constantly complaints over the years, from social media to literal memes about Crysis. 

It’s beyond frustrating that we live in a world where games have been poorly optimized and now GPU manufactures created a bandaid fix with frame generation which is exactly what most recent dilemma is Monster Hunter Wilds with the devs solved the issue by turning this on as a solution.

I’m not an organizer for something like his but I’d love to be apart of an organization that finally gets the ball rolling on this topic instead of just meming about it and “dealing with it”. 

What would the end result of this look like? Well clearly games not in a piss poor state upon release for starters, but also that large distributors of games like MS, Sony, Nintendo, Valve and yes even sites like greenmangaming should allow customers to request a refund if the game is in a broken state upon release that goes beyond the 2 hours. While I understand for smaller devs there needs to be some similar but not as harsh rules, this is mainly targeted at larger studios. We all know 2 hours is NOT enough time to really try a game. On average you’re just getting past the tutorial and gathering a baseline of how the game works. 

This also would help with gamers not having to fork over their hard earned money on extremely expensive and limited stock of hardware just to play these games at a “decent” state. We should be living in a world now with the advancements in tech where in order for me to play a AAA game at 60-90fps doesn’t require a current top of the line GPU from any manufacture. We shouldn’t have to wait for a Nintendo switch 2 to FINALLY play original switch titles at their expected performance. 

I would really like to hear from the community what suggestions collectively we could do to start this. I’d like an actual conversation with some sort of ground work. The “vote with your wallet” doesn’t exactly work. It has helped a small handful of times in the last and devs have fixed their games later on, but this shouldn’t even have to be the norm we live in today.

Edit: Amazing the only responses are basically just ""don't buy day 1/pre-order"" which misses the point.

Meanwhile I can easily ignore it and still enjoy the game while others act like the game is ruined over it.

Even in older games before the F2P methods even existed, I never had the desire to grind out for cosmetics. The gameplay itself was enough to carry my interest for years. I guess my brain never left that mentality.

gaming,1ltzykj,I’m sad that we will never see the “Nemesis System” mechanic in a game for a long time.,"Thanks WB.  Closing Monolith that made a couple of games, Shadow of Mordor/War, only to shut them down and patent the mechanic until 2036.   Sure, they could license out the mechanic to another studio if they want to use it, but I doubt that’s going to happen.  

The nemesis system was so unique and instantly made Shadow or Mordor such a unique game that still stands up to this day (more than War, imo).   It’s a shame that we will likely never seen it again especially since the Wonder Woman game was cancelled, as there was word that they were going to implement that mechanic into that game.

They are contributing to the rise of game prices, and doing everything they can to corner people into Game Pass subscription.

Sure, Game Pass may look attractive now. Relatively cheap, access to a huge catalog, cross-platform. 
But look at Netflix 10 years ago vs Netflix now! Netflix 10 years ago was no ads, cheap subscription, huge catalog, good originals and exclusive. Now, every media company has their own platform, the catalog on Netflix is shittier every year, their originals mostly suck or get milked until all the substance is gone, the prices are getting higher and higher, and there are even ads in the lower tier subscription now.

The same thing will happen with Game Pass: It will get more expensive, titles will be removed from it, and the push to have more ""original"" content will favor releasing mediocre quality stuff, done with GenAI so they don't have to pay actual talent.

gaming,1lt4dnc,"Clearing my backlog, I may be some time.","After not really being inspired by the Steam sale, and spending most of the last 2 years mainly playing SoulsBorne games, I have decided to finally put some effort in clearing my backlog, on all platforms, PC (Steam, Epic), PS(5) Xbox (Series X), PSVR and PCVR/Quest. I may be some time.

This is only around 180 games on each platform which is no where near as much as I thought. I am initially focusing on Steam, then Epic, probably look at the other PC storefronts too dependent on how quick I get through it.

Primary goal is finishing the game, reaching the end. Achievements/Trophies are secondary, and completely dependent on how much I enjoy the game as to whether I go hunting.

However, I do 2 rules:

* No account creating. For games that require additional launchers, or third party accounts, if I can play it without creating an account I will do to get a feel for it, otherwise, I will not be playing.
* Only playing games I own. No F&F. My son has bought some real garbage over the years. I may make an exception for Cyberpunk 2077, though.

Also, PCVR will its own section as I prefer to play VR in Winter.

I have already sunk and hour into AdventureQuest 3D (as a quest) this afternoon, I quite enjoyed its simple play style and short quests, so may go back to it afterwards, but who knows. However the overload of puns was a bit daft.

I also ruled out APB Reloaded as it requires creating an account.

So Looks like I am moving on to Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I have already completed this game on PS and Xbox, so should be a quick run through.

I have no plans for streaming or publishing any videos, I may record the raw footage though.

Done FF7 og, FF9 and FF10, hated FF13 and 15 but hardly played them. Picked up 16 and well it’s ok…….but hardly buzzing about playing it again. Love Hades and Slay the Spire but played them to death.

I was diehard for Nethack when it was first coming out. As for souls likes well they are what they are. I suspect if I had been younger when they came out as a phenomenon I would have loved them. By the time soulslike was a thing I just didn't have the reaction speed to get that far into the games. The idea of a corpserun after death just didn't appeal to me, because that would become like a trap. Im not saying I'm the best gamer far from it. What I am saying is that a good part of the gamer population is around my age, and so games tune to the reaction times of prebubescants might be off for the wider audience. Every time I see soulslike in a description of a game I see that its not made for people like me. 

I also don't play free games because those games aren't free and they manipulate difficulty / progression artificially to pressure people to spend money. I just don't want to play a living advertisement that I know is always trying to manipulate me.

The game industry now caters to the (hardcore) gamer and that's just not me. When you combine a rougelike and a soulslike that is always increasing in difficulty Im never going to finish that game.

My friends played it too, and some of our best mutual memories from that time come from our countless hot seat matches. However, one guy in our group of friends was a bit overly competitive, so playing anything with him could (and often would) turn into a non-fun activity. This one time we ended up at my place at crazy hours after a night out and decided to play a hot seat match of HoMM 3, after which he would go home, and I would go to sleep. Great idea, right? So, the game took about an hour or more, before I got him cornered in the last battle, with stronger army than his. He was in a hopeless situation, so I almost expected him to surrender and then quickly leave my place so I could finally get some sleep, and what ... he ... does ... is ... RETREAT!

- ""Why not? The option is right there.""

gaming,1lrmcaa,You should be grateful Xbox is falling apart and here is why,"The idea behind the Game Pass is basically the same as what Epic Games is doing with its free games:
engage users and create value within the platform through progress, achievements, and ownership inside the ecosystem, encouraging them to stay (ideally exclusively) in their system.

And this is perfectly normal for any corporation. - to aggressively “buy” users with free content, because in the long run, when they conquer the market, they will profit from all those acquisition investments.

Of course, this was the only option for acquiring all publishers: to make us quit Steam, Epic, PlayStation, literally everything else.

The problems begin only when you think about what happens next, when this strategy succeeds and we all live in the happy Microsoft ecosystem, playing all these “free” games.

The thing is, Microsoft is a public company and must generate more revenue every year to be considered successful. And there is only one way to do this in the long run: cut the content of base games included in the subscription, and move more and more content into paid DLC, in-game purchases, and other predatory practices.

gaming,1lrkvo1,"If survival horror games were made the way they used to be, could they look photo-realistic?","Games like resident evil used to let players move on a 3 dimensional plane, but with fixed camera angles. They were like semi-3d.

They usually had janky controls, and maybe it made sense for how the game was designed. Obviously nobody would accept those controls in 2025 so let's say they have fixed that.

With today's hardware, could they make a game like that look like real life? Since they have tighter control over what you see and do, they don't have to worry about what angle you view something at or how close you are to a texture.

In those games, you mostly walked around small rooms so you only worried about loading the next room as needed. Even for outside areas you were limited to a specific path.

Think of a game like fatal frame that is 2d when roaming around but full 3d when you are in camera mode. I feel like the ghosts and jump scares could look like movie quality. Yes the gameplay for such a game isn't likely to be as good as playing one of the remakes, but must from a presentation standpoint it should be better, right?

How good could a game like that look? Would you want to play it (assuming it controlled better than a game from 1998)?",10,31,1751641288.0,,0.6,True,False,lilb1190,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lrkvo1/if_survival_horror_games_were_made_the_way_they/,new,low
gaming,1lrkna5,It’s Now or Never for Banjo Threeie,"
With Microsoft’s cancellation of Everwild and Perfect Dark, Rare’s team and their IPs are at risk of becoming irrelevant.

I can see Perfect Dark struggling to find an audience in the flooded FPS market, but Banjo is a beloved character that Microsoft has failed to capitalize on.

And time is running out.

Banjo is beloved to the kids of the 90s, who spent countless hours collecting in Rare’s wonderfully crafted worlds. Most of these kids are now adults, with their own kids. 

The current generation may not be as familiar with Banjo but their parents are, and they’ll likely purchase it to play with them. But this window of time is coming to a close, soon adults born after the initial N64 games will be having kids and they won’t have the same nostalgic attachment. 

Microsoft and Rare need to maintain their IP and reintroduce Banjo to a new generation before he becomes a lost relic of retro gaming.

Once I passed the >!Plate Gate!< for the first time into >!Australia!< I skipped the ship & set out with what I had on me to explore the map for prepper stations. Extra blood bags, a pistol & a few grenades.

It has turned into one of the best open world exploration experiences I've ever played.

It suddenly feels like a survival game being so far away from a terminal & having to forage for resources. To have to be careful & manage my stamina or sneaking into bases for items.

And to see the landscapes for the first time unmarked by others (or me for that matter) makes for some epic views. Like being in Blade Runner movie.

It also kinda feels like playing Shadow of the Colossus on steroids, in a way.

I'd highly recommend it in exploring the map for the first time.

Let yourself be the weird nerd dude at the party like Scott Pilgrim talking about Pac-Man. No matter if it’s something long or short, just something you like and want to share. I’ll start with something easy:

In Xenoblade Chronicles 2 there’s a gacha system (no micro transactions) with which you pull blades to fight with. One of these blades is called KOS-MOS, and is one of the strongest blades available. Being as strong as she is, there’s only a 0.1% drop chance. It’s so hard to get some people have farmed the item needed to pull blades for hundreds of hours and still have had no luck at all to get her.

Well, during my second play through I got her pretty early in the game. To this day I think I still don’t comprehend how lucky that actually was. Played with her for the entire game and enjoyed my play through a ton. But there is a huge downside to this, and I guess it’s something every person who got her have. The game only allows a single save slot. There’s NG+ with the ability to start from level 1 and all. But I would really like to start a fresh run from scratch, without having money, gear, blades, etc. and at the same time I don’t want to lose my KOS-MOS save.

Each world has its own visual and musical identity, from lush forests and underwater caves to icy peaks and spooky valleys, and the game does a good job introducing new mechanics like ice sliding, swimming, or wall jumping to keep things fresh. Pac-Man’s movement feels snappy and satisfying, and abilities like the butt bounce and the rev roll are fun to use, adding a nice layer of personality to the platforming. The rev roll in particular gives the gameplay a sense of speed and momentum that helps distinguish it from other mascot platformers of the era. That said, not everything has aged perfectly. The camera can be clunky, especially in tight spaces or underwater sections where it doesn’t always follow the action well, leading to some frustrating deaths. Later levels sometimes rely too much on trial and error, with sudden falls and bottomless pits that feel more cheap than challenging. The collectible system can be addictive if you’re a completionist, but also annoying if you realize you missed a fruit at the start of a long level and need to replay the whole thing. Despite these issues, the game has a lot of charm. The soundtrack is catchy, the boss battles have a simple arcade-style fun, and including the original Pac-Man game as an unlockable extra is a great nod to the series’ roots. Overall, Pac-Man World 2 is a colorful and underrated 3D platformer that may show its age at times, but still delivers a fun and memorable experience with a lot of heart.

gaming,1lqbpfc,Which tropes or mechanics do you think are overdone in the RTS genre? And what's something you'd like to see in an RTS that you don't see much of?,"Hello peeps! I'm working on a little side project of mine, making an RTS in Godot based around some worldbuilding and art concept I've developed in the last few years, and while I wouldn't want to get completely sidestepped by outside input I am curious how I could make mine stand out (provided it ever sees the light of day).

I myself grew up playing Panzers Codename 1 and 2, Age of Empires 3, Africa Korp VS Desert Rats, Man of War, Battle for Middle Earth and... I guess Spore's civilization stage technically counts? And in recent years I've enjoyed playing Stellaris, Iron Harvest, and to a lesser degree HOI4. So those are currently my frames of reference, and particularly I've always liked the inclusion of heroe characters on the map, since it's an easy tool for diving into storytelling and exposition. I do like the customization side some of these games offer for your units as well, while something I kinda dislike is how games like HOI4 have just so much stuff to keep track of to the point combat itself seems to take a step to the side. Oh, and something I also enjoy is being able to take control of individual units like in Man of War. But regardless, I'm curious to hear any input if you'd like to share, so thank you in advance :)",2,32,1751501918.0,,0.54,True,False,RaptarK,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lqbpfc/which_tropes_or_mechanics_do_you_think_are/,new,low
gaming,1lqdu4r,We are missing a good mage / wizard game,"I really really think we are missing the market for a great wizard / mage game. Hogwarts was CLOSE but I still think we need a great game where you are more than just a wizard with a gun wand shooting frost, fire, and lightning. I love the magic system in WoW but I want a good story game

I want a game that has a ton of just unique spells that interact with the world. That's the fun part of imaging being a wizard. I want to be able to pull water out of the river and turn it into ice for a bridge, or throw it at people. I want to be able to summon familiars, or use a spell to disguise myself to look super old or young. 

I feel like there ARE a ton of games that have these mechanics, but it doesn't encapsulate the wide berth of magic that we see in the fantasy world at large. It's usually just a small slice of magic. Trine and Trine 2 comes to mind, with the way you use magic to solve puzzles. 

But I want my combat to be more than just lasers out of a wand. Let me summon a giant fire tornado, or a massive snake. 

Watching the fight between Dumbledor and Voldemort, or the fights in Frieren just makes me so jealous that we don't have a game that can re-create that",535,323,1751508321.0,,0.87,True,False,Bright-Efficiency-65,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lqdu4r/we_are_missing_a_good_mage_wizard_game/,new,medium

gaming,1lq10za,Trying to understand SKG: Why shouldn't a creator of an online game have the right to shut down fully their own creation?,"If I'm understanding the SKG initiative correctly, say I wanted to make an online game, and provide access to this game via a client the user can subscribe to for some monthly fee. This user is also given the opportunity to know that this game may shut down fully (fully meaning they wouldn't have to do any end of life support, wouldn't have to release the server files, etc) for any reason (or maybe more accurately after some final month to ensure their last fee wasn't completely wasted) before any point of purchase of their subscription, I wouldn't be able to do this? Specifically completely shut down my own game, and not have to release any part of it afterwards. Or maybe this still would be allowed and I'm misunderstanding something, but anyway...

With all that said, it seems like many people have mention a few things.

1. ""Why would someone ever want their own work destroyed?"" - To that, I don't really see why someone else's desire or reason to do whatever they want to their own work should be questioned, or at most stopped. It's their work, if they currently own it / have possession of it, etc, by all means, let them do whatever they want to it.

2. ""What if someone came into your home to destroy your TV, book, painting, etc?"" - This analogy doesn't work with an online game, or more accurately, the permission to access information that lives on a server from your client. I can understand yeah, if you bought something fully (as with an mmo you aren't purchasing the entire full stack environment) you now own that thing, and tough luck for the creator to try and do anything about it.

3. ""Why wouldn't they just be able to release the game's server data, they're not using it anymore, etc? - Similar to point 1, they don't have to, and there might be good reason, say some game rework, wanting to make something for a limited time only, etc. Sure, it would be nice to release everything, as it would continue on whatever they've made and people could continue to play something they enjoy, but again, it's something they shouldn't be enforced to do, in any manner. (Also note: in some cases server code might be source code itself, as with some of my online games, SKG has mentioned source code wouldn't need to be released, and I could wrap code in some obfuscation, or some other method, but I would disagree that their initiative should dictate how I write my server code, which leads back to what their initiative kind of boils down to anyway...)

Keep in mind I don't even live in the region where this is being proposed, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of everything. And I'm not trying to ""attack"" or just discredit the SKG movement as I would also like every single game to be preserved. I love games and have spent probably too much of my life playing them. But I run into this issue in my head about if some creator wanted to shut down access to their game, who am I to be able to do anything about it? I'm not entitled to their IP, and what money I've spent on it doesn't cover any ownership over what was running on the server. Sure, maybe this is exactly what SKG is trying to do, and I would have to disagree with it due to removing the ability of choice for some creator who may just want their creations to be shut down for whatever reason they may have.",0,51,1751475252.0,,0.26,True,False,Lunarcomplex,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lq10za/trying_to_understand_skg_why_shouldnt_a_creator/,new,low

2.,And if you’ve never played, what’s kept you from giving it a chance?

gaming,1lpzvr5,why has there been such a massive amount of misinformation around the switch 2?,"i know this is r/gaming so this is probably going to be giga downvoted and i’m gonna be accused of bootlicking the billion dollar corporation or whatever, but i really can’t wrap my head around how there’s been so much easily disprovable misinformation around the switch 2

and i understand, nintendo does a lot of questionable things like being debatably TOO protective of their ip and things of that nature, but people have legitimately just been making things up or lying to make it seem worse

but like 

1. “$80 games are the standard now” just not true. this MIGHT be subject to change, so we’ll say this is the weakest point, but at the time of writing, it’s literally only mario kart. and whether you agree or disagree, mario kart world is a game people are going to be playing for a decade if the last game is any indicator. if there’s any game that COULD even theoretically justify a higher price for the amount of value you’re going to get from it over time, mario kart is certainly one of the few. any of the “$80” switch 2 editions of games like tears of the kingdom and kirby are effectively just a $70 and $60 game with a $10 and $20 dlc, and donkey kong is $70. we can criticize not making the base price of the older games lower so that a $10 or $20 dlc doesn’t bring it up to $80, but that’s different from $80 being “standard”. 

2. “physical games are more expensive than digital” there is no evidence to suggest that this is true in any sort of widespread capacity. the only source to this claim was a single website that i haven’t even seen any follow-ups on, but even on the tiny chance that it is true, it’s just for that singular region and not something new

3. “nintendo changed their EULA so they can brick your console for no reason whenever they want”. for one, this is language that is similar across all console manufacturers from the moment consoles were consistently connected to the internet all the way back to the wii/ps3 era. this is not a new nor a uniquely nintendo concept. secondly, they do not brick your console, they restrict it from accessing any online features is they detect or suspect things like piracy. again, this is not new, console manufacturers of all brands have been doing this for years. one of the first things you would hear back in the day if you wanted to mod a 3ds was “make sure you do NOT connect to the internet on the modded console” for exactly this reason. you can still play your physical games just fine (which leads to the next point), the console is FAR from “bricked”

4. “physical games are dead all the games are basically just codes in boxes”. this is entirely on third parties, and, once again also not new or unique to nintendo. the newest doom, for example, is not fully on disc and requires an internet download. and even then, at the time of writing, all first party nintendo games and nintendo switch 2 editions of older first party games are all fully on cart with all content, no internet needed. cyberpunk on switch 2 is also fully on cart, demonstrating that it IS possible and this is a conscious decision from developers. i’ve heard that the larger carts are a bit more expensive to produce, but, just like everyone constantly says about nintendo, these are almost all multibillion dollar corporations and publishers, they can afford to print the more expensive carts. until a first party nintendo game is released as a game key-card, this is not a complaint to leverage at nintendo specifically 

and i’m sure there might be a few more i’m not remembering right now 

all of these are things that take like 5 seconds of googling or just using your eyes to see that they’re not true, but a month later i’m still seeing tons of people peddling these myths as if they’re unquestionable fact. some of it is definitely the fault of the gaming publications reporting dubious unsubstantiated claims, not doing their due diligence by fact checking before publishing, but that’s only up to a point. eventually it’s on us to do our own research and confirm information",0,70,1751472562.0,,0.41,True,False,brando-boy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lpzvr5/why_has_there_been_such_a_massive_amount_of/,new,low
gaming,1lpz0ga,Fallout 4,"I understand that the fallout series is very beloved. I am a recent return to console gaming (last 2 years) and my last console being a ps2. I have been playing up as many older beloved games as I can get my hands on to catch up on gaming experiences I missed. 

I just started Fallout 4, and I don’t plan to quit it just yet but usually within an hour of gameplay a game will grab my interest.

gaming,1lpy7lm,Death Stranding 1 & 2 are the closest games to a real journey I've played,"I've toured as a roadie for months on end. 

The first time was grueling. Difficult. Tested me in ways I didn't forsee. The glamour wears off pretty quick when you haven't showered in 5 days, have gotten little sleep and still have to drive 8 hours to the next city. 

You know how Sam just plops down and passes out when he rests in a private room? That's pretty much how it is when you can afford a motel for a night. I didn't know what to expect. Didn't know what to bring. 

Kinda like Death Stranding 1.

The tradeoff is seeing country you've never seen. Food you've never eaten. Landscapes that are just gorgeous. I still remember the shadow of a mountain stretching across the plains one early morning. 

The 2nd time I toured for months was way easier. More streamlined. I knew what to bring (flushable wipes!), knew what to expect, knew how to manage myself. I knew how to organize our cargo, how to better deal with the road.

Kinda like Death Stranding 2.

So the closest games I've personally played that mimick that sense of travel, evolution & accomplishment are these games.

And if you ever get the opportunity to travel, take it. There's nothing quite so humbling as being a stranger in a strange land.

gaming,1lpvenc,Microsoft Begins Deep Job Cuts Across Xbox Division,"[Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US)'s gaming division began informing employees of job cuts on Wednesday morning, initiating the process of widespread layoffs that staff have been expecting for the last week.  
  
\- Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes *Candy Crush*, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs, according to people familiar with the plans. 

\- Other European offices, such as ZeniMax, also began informing employees that job cuts were happening, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to press.  
  
US units were expected to be told later Wednesday how many jobs would be cut at each office. Microsoft's gaming division had about 20,000 employees as of January 2024.  
  
Employees had been bracing for the job cuts since May, when Microsoft began conducting companywide layoffs and speculation mounted that the gaming division might be impacted. Many staff learned last week through a Bloomberg report that the cuts were imminent.

It puts a smile on my face every time I pick it up, between the gameplay, the charm of the world, the creativity of the music, and the goofy banter of the characters. Every world is completely unique and set up in a way that rewards you for exploring. You can 100% the game without really ever needing to tap into a walkthrough or videos - the game just is so open and gives you so many different ways to explore.

There's just so many things that the game does perfectly. The characters and dialogue are so creative with even side characters having memorable moments and being endearing. The music is absolutely fantastic, and the way you earn new abilities as you explore new worlds feels like such a natural progression system. The morphs and the added castle secrets just add more and more layers on what is already such a wonderful gameplay experience.

As if the game wasn't good enough already, it drops the best world in any collectathon game Click Clock Wood, which is a forest world you explore across four seasons. You plant a tree, help hatch and raise an eagle, help a fatass squirrel who you watched binge eat all his nuts early, and go through so many cool little exploration quirks and experiences as you begin to wrap up the game.

But in some ways it seems like game engines or tech have declined. I'll focus on the shooter genre because that's where I really notice it.

Battlefield 3 came out in 2011 and had pretty robust destructible environments and supported quite large battles with lots of vehicles going at once.

Same can be said for Planetside 2 being able to support massive battles with tons of effects at this time, just has another example.

Now 14 years later, barely any shooters seem to include destructible environments or massive scale battles.

For example, Arma Reforger recently introduced terrain destruction, but it's not even halfway to realism of Battlefield 3, a game released in 2011, in this sense.

Is the industry losing its touch with some of this tech? Or is it just because all shooters are cartoon battle royale copy pastes now?

Why are features from 2011 games seemingly so difficult to implement in 2025?",0,60,1751379110.0,,0.34,True,False,TheSyrupCompany,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lp2pip/decline_in_gaming_technology/,new,low

gaming,1loykx6,Would you be against blocking messages to minors being standard practice in most games where you make an account?,"https://preview.redd.it/xd5tsbd1s8af1.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=83a6dfb422f97c0eea11586bbb851f2515c33297

I suppose I should open this by saying I haven’t played *Persona 5: The Phantom X*, and maybe I’m late to the party, but I read today that the game actively blocks accounts that claim to be over 18 from privately messaging accounts registered as under 18. I just had the biggest “Huh, this should probably be standard practice” moment.

I can only think of three logical concerns people might raise:

1. **What if you turn 18 and all your friends are 16–17?** In that case, maybe a video game private chat shouldn’t be your main method of communication—or perhaps accounts could recognize active friendships and allow messaging with users who were already connected before the age threshold.
2. **Kids shouldn’t be playing age-rated games anyway, or minors could be lying about their age.** To which I’d say…sure, but if you want access to 18+ features, you could choose to opt out of these protections at your own risk, rather than having no guardrails at all.
3. **Predators could just make accounts registered as under 18.** That’s a valid concern, but if accounts claiming to be minors are behaving inappropriately with other minors, that actually makes it easier to flag and identify those individuals. It removes the common “I didn’t know how young they were” excuse and helps platforms hold people accountable.

I’m curious to hear how everyone would feel if this sort of system suddenly became the universal standard on services like Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.",661,338,1751367269.0,,0.84,True,False,British_Historian,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1loykx6/would_you_be_against_blocking_messages_to_minors/,new,medium

gaming,1lote3j,"Vent: Less time I have for gaming, more I buy and analyse my collection","Allright, so I was always ""smart"" gamer in that regard, that I was buying only those games I was going to play in the near  future, ideally immediately. 

Once we had our children, I basically stopped buying games and played only those from my backlog (I have PS+, so naturally some backlog is created after some time). I had few purchases, but mostly I played them right away.  

So far so good, but last few months I started to feel that I miss playing games more. You know, one of those periods, when you want dive deeper into given hobby. But I am not able to... 

My children are going to bed later and later (9 pm) and me and my wife want to spend some time together. So I have only some playing time with my kids (0.5 h per day aprox.), with my wife (she plays with me few games, or watch me play, but its not here first choice of hobby, so its like once per week), or late in the evening when everybody went to sleep, but you guess it, I fall asleep after one hour or so, and this one hour of gaming isnt the best either because I am tired.

Now to get to the point of this post: I keep constantly thinking about games, but I am not able to enjoy them properly. Dont get me wrong, I love playing games with my kids, but I also wanna some solo gaming sessions, those are much different (different games, different immersion etc). 

So instead of gaming I make purchases, I read reviews and I am managing my backlog, giving each game I have priority order, writing down time needed to complete given game etc. only to not be able to play those games in the first place (I do those thing at work or at phone). And its really exhausting.

gaming,1lor5s0,Something occurred to me today about gaming: it is one of the few truly shared cultural experiences left,"Bear with me. As a 90s kid I was lamenting the loss of things like Saturday morning TV shows where almost every kid in the country would come to school the following Monday having seen the same shows and skits and have that shared cultural experience. Even at the time we would often be watching it with our siblings whereas now kids are isolated to an individual screen consuming fragmented short form content that their friends will likely never be aware of let alone discuss/minic/riff on together.

It seems like the only medium that still has a very strong sense of a shared cultural experience where we are all still mostly consuming or at least aware of, and discussing, the same content is gaming.

For all the negativity we have around eg. The AAA space at least it’s a kind of shared cultural narrative that we are all a part of in some way. I have no idea what people are reading or watching or listening to anymore but I know we’re all here arguing over the graphics of new Pokemon games and freaking out at the latest from some venerated gaming icon like Kojima etc.

Kind of comforting in a way. I’m not sure if gaming will ever become as fragmented as other media, I wonder why? I don’t think it’s just that it’s harder to make games so there’s less choice, I think it might be 1) because talking about it is half the fun and 2) because gamers are honestly some of the biggest snobs around (and I think that’s great, quality - even our subjective perception of it - matters).",0,23,1751339370.0,,0.32,True,False,LaCaipirinha,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lor5s0/something_occurred_to_me_today_about_gaming_it_is/,new,low

gaming,1lopelh,What Are Your Experiences Trying To Get Non-Gamers Into Gaming?,"Hey everyone, in the past I'd tried on multiple occasions to get my parents into games, and it resulted in a lot of failed attempts but every now and then I still get the urge to try again with the logic that maybe I just hadn't been picking games that'd be suitable to their sensibilities. These are some examples of my mom's experiences:

**Persona 4 Golden** \- Right off the bat it probably was not the best idea to start off with a JRPG, as on top of how deep mechanics can get, she couldn't fathom how a video game could be 70+ hours long. She liked the country town setting but quickly got bored by the long intro segment and I don't think she could really take it all that seriously because of the anime aesthetic.  At the time I just wanted to share something I'd enjoyed with her, but I'm actually glad she didn't continue because of the ""fanservice-y"" stuff in the game and one of the dungeons for>!a 15yr old character being a literal strip club...!<

**Breath of the Wild** \- I thought the sort of ""sandbox"" aspect of it would lend itself well to someone getting acclimated, but again she quickly got bored, this time's reasoning being that having so much freedom and only having vague reminders of what she ""should"" be doing instead of having more straightforward progression made it feel like her exploration and actions didn't really mean anything, so she gave up within the hour. Interesting how what many consider the game's biggest strength was a sour spot for someone not very familiar with the medium.

**Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** \- I figured she'd like this one for the multiplayer aspect, but she couldn't get a good grip on the controls and it requiring constant action from the player was just a bit too much for her. Although she kept bumping into walls she didn't want the handicaps like smart steering on either, so we moved onto Smash Ultimate.

**Smash Ultimate** \- I'm surprised that she actually enjoyed her time with this one. Compared to Mario Kart I'd always considered Smash the much more complex of the two but she seemed to get the gist pretty quickly, and despite not knowing who a good chunk of the roster was she liked how many characters there were to choose from because it never made matches feel stale.

**Undertale** \- Despite also being an RPG, compared to a traditional one I felt it was lighter on the mechanics side and I figured she'd at least find some charm in the characters and writing. This one had a bit more going on so I'll bullet it:  
  
\- The simplistic graphics and a lack of voice acting for all that text seemed to be an innate barrier that made it hard for her to get immersed.   
  
\- She never had a great sense of direction in the ruins, so she'd often exit a room only to walk right back into it thinking she was entering a new one and be confused why she wasn't making progress.

\- The battle system confused her, as she didn't see much point to adding extra steps by using the act commands and sparing when she could just kill the enemies, and also wasn't great at dodging enemy attacks  
  
\- Because she kept getting lost, she'd naturally trigger a lot of random encounters which frustrated her because she didn't understand why the same enemies she had ""beaten already"" kept appearing

I remember her seeing Sans and Papyrus, so we made it out of the ruins but I don't remember if I might've helped her or took over at some point because she got too annoyed. Regardless, she didn't seem to want to play again.

But anyways, this might've been a loaded read, but feel free to share your own experiences or advice as well!

Only two people were interested. The rest didn’t care because it didn’t give them in-game currency or help their grind. That’s wild to me.

gaming,1lntyv1,Pockets of Gaming Glory,"Just randomly thinking today while in the kitchen that each era of gamers born got to have their prime year experiences with certain online games and no other generation before or after will be able to experience it. 

Like I was born in 1993 and I got to play xbox live when it first came out and play Halo 2 with everyone that was likely around my era. Glitching by sword canceling out of the map on Gemini with 15 online strangers is something that wont happen for anyone born 2000s and after. Only the generation that were probably ages 11-35 at that time got to experience it. Then into playing Halo 3 online and having so many moments. 

 Then you get older, start a family and have a responsibility. All the while new online games are coming out and a younger generation is playing these online games in their prime gaming years cementing memories of their favorite games that just happen to be big in that era (fortnite, roblox, etc). 


So they wouldnt understand the feeling of super bouncing on lockout, doing the elevator glitch on call of duty 2, playing offline multiplayer on Time Splitters 2 etc. 

And only the group that was playing these games in their prime will have that connection and understanding when talking about these games. Its like a special bond we have from the era we grew up playing in. And each generation will have their own.

  I dont know its just a random thought and I wanted to share. My son is 2 now and I hope during his prime years are some great games he can make memories with friends.

gaming,1lnlike,So I had a realization when it comes to Shooters-Valorant-Siege-cs-etc,"So first a small bit of context. I play a lot of shooters, even the bad ones, a game a really didn’t touch or play often was Valorant. I found the game to be just too toxic, terribly un-optimized, and just over all bad for my mental health. Recently a friend group of mine along with some co-workers, had gotten me into the game proper and while there are some gripes  I still have, I’ve been having a lot of fun thanks for to my friends being with me. but because of this playing Valorant made me come to this realization due to some of the skins and bundles that have come out over the past year.

SOUND EFFECTS/ GUNSHOTS MATTER. 

I’m not even referring to the fact that you need good sound effects to make the gameplay more engaging and satisfying for player, though that is another reason you should. 

What I’m talking about here is that the sounds can actively make you a better player. If you the sounds of the guns are weak too fast,or don’t really sound that good and can create a sub conscious feeling of the gun being light and quick which; in turn will mess you up and you’ll lose most gun fights. I took a pretty heavy note in Valorant of the default skins and guns sounds are… ok, but when I find players who are doing really well(my friends included) usually remark that it’s when they use a certain skin. 
I realized this has to be because of the sound effects the skins that people like and do better with have a heavy, chunkier, powerful sound which I think leads people to be more cautious and accurate. 

“Ok” you might be wondering “what about other games like Cs or Siege like you mentioned?” Well for Cs it’s because they had the sound effect down already wanting it to sound realistic, almost like the same feeling when some one hears a really satisfying sound/ garand ping, they’ll want to better with that gun just to get that sound. When it comes to siege, a lot of people’s top pick operators will also relate to the gun like the MP5 for doc or Smoke’s shotgun, siege can also get away slightly with slightly different sounding guns because it’s aided by the destructible environment, Lesion’s suppressed shotgun may not Feel or sound strong but when you’re blasting massive holes and dry wall that compensates. 


TLDR: Having satisfying sounds for your guns and make you a better player. 


Let me know what you guys think, and do you have any games where you especially the love the sounds of the weapons? Really love to know some thoughts on this

Besides, if its anything like DS1 you won't even be touching the ground by the end of it. I started doing foot deliveries in the post-game of DS1 because I started to miss the treks.

Not sure how to put words on this. 

There is a whole aesthethic in sci fi landscape during the 90's , early 2000 that is so special to me. 

I am currently playing KOTOR 2, and this saga is so special in its atmosphere. The Star Wars universe helps a lot of course, but there is something in those landscape. To me they feel comfortable, nostalgic and kinda strange. In Dantooine KOTOR, the mix of the minimalistic natural landscape, with some sci fi details such as a speeder that is parked around a tree, a farmhouse with grass on its top, the flying stringray above the landscape.... It just give me this ""wow"" feeling. 

I say ""nostalgic"" but I never played those game when they were released. I dont have any particular connection to them. Yet, thats how they make me feel. 

Other games that makes me feel the same way : Final Fantasy X and especially the Besaid easthethic. The Wipeout series and especially the tracks that are set in nature :

I am craving for games like those. Maybe there is some modern equivalent, but I think AAA graphics are not compatible with this feeling. Maybe in some indie titles ? 

 I am sorry if this is very vague, I am bad at puting words on my feelings. I hope you will still understand what I am trying to describe here. 

Thank you for reading :)

gaming,1ln488c,I'm starting to understand why people criticize Stellar Blade,"I'm about 23 hours in and I think the honeymoon phase is over. First of all, 7 hours worth of side content in between Alpha Naytibas is way too much. I am a completionist and loot goblin at heart. I like to check behind every corner for crates and people, I always go in the opposite direction of the objective, and I like to do all available side missions and puzzles to give me an edge. I was certainly overgeared and over specced after doing everything before heading off to Matrix 11. It allowed me to beat Tachy in only 2 tries, which was nice, but now I've experienced another 7 hrs of quests before I can head to the 3rd Naytiba. And to what end? I'm already extremely overgeared/ specced from the first round.  
Combat is cheese. When I first unlocked the beta skills and ranged I thought they were a little OP and didn't want to use them because it would make the game too easy. But now I find myself cheesing every fight because if I don't I just won't make progress in a timely fashion. The dodge is extremely unreliable, and barely moves Eve. The combos don't work half the time, and neither do the counter attacks/ blink skills. The parry is the only thing that works well, which is unfortunate because it has a health bar (shield). I shamelessly stock WB pumps because I know every time I die it's because the enemy cheesed me before I could cheese him.  
I was extremely hyped about this game when it hit PC and thought for sure I would happily rate it a 9/10 or 10/10. But the way I'm feeling now it's slowly sliding to the 4-6/10 range. I know someone is going to respond to my first paragraph by saying, ""you don't have to do the side quests,"" and someone is going to respond to the second paragraph by saying, ""skill issue.""  
 Overall, when you get over the gooner honeymoon this game is kinda ass actually. I didn't have any issues beating Jedi on Grandmaster because that game actually responded to your inputs. This game just feels extremely unresponsive from a combat perspective.

gaming,1lmmdjb,Genre Bending,"The Mario franchise is an example of a franchise that crosses over to numerous gaming genres frequently- from racing, to platforming, to sports and beyond. 

But, Mario is an easy franchise to adapt to multiple genres due to the very light hearted and imaginative nature of the games.

What do you think would be a good franchise to crossover to different Genres, in a way that actually makes sense and fits the story/universe to some extent?

One example of mine would be a Resident Evil fighting game. The story would be that the main characters are a team of specialists investigating more reports of T-Virus shenanigans in another remote area of the planet.

They get captured, and learn that a secretive cult is using heavily modified strains of the virus to enhance physical abilities of humans, to various degrees of effect and success. Not trying to create total abominations, but merely enhance the “human experience”. 

They test their “super soldiers” in what is essentially cage fighting, and now that they’ve gotten their hands on a crew of highly trained and skilled bio-terror specialists, they can *really* put their creations to the test. 

What results is a somewhat traditional side-view fighting game, but heavily dosed with story and cinematics. You have to try to survive the fights with your crew of 8, and you get different endings depending on how many of your crew are left by the end. 

Of course, at some point things go off the rails and instead of just a cage fight, there will be a side-scrolling escape segment where you use everything you’ve learned so far to escape the facility, quick-swapping between whatever crew members remain alive to fight through generic goons as enhanced warriors alike.

I don’t know. Maybe this is stupid as hell but I feel like RE is a good franchise to expand into different genres.

gaming,1lm16o2,I Made an Essential Games List for My Console Newbie Coworker. How did I do? What should I change?,"I recently began trying to introduce my younger coworker to the joys of retro gaming, and when he told me he didn’t know where to start I decided to make a little cheat-sheet of some of the most essential game experiences out there. I had so much fun with it, I ended up turning it into a whole big thing where I touch on pretty much every notable console/handheld/arcade machine.

In order to give him the most rounded selection I could, I made some constraints for myself.

1. Only one entry per series per console. So, no including both Sonic 2 and 3 for the Genesis list, even though both are deserving. It also means no Majora’s Mask, whomp whomp. Sequels were fine if they were on other platforms.

2. No duplicate entries across all lists. For instance, Chrono Trigger will not show up on the DS list, because it’s on the SNES one.

3. For games with multiple iterations, like ports, multiplatform releases, remasters, etc, I tended to either pick the original for it’s importance (like RE4), or for the best-playing experience (like Wind Waker HD), based on which one I felt was more significant. If you see something important missing, check at the bottom to see if the Arcade version is listed.

On that note, this is not a Top-10 “Best” Games list, or even a Top-10 Personal Favorites list. It’s also not a ranked list, the relative placement of a game means nothing. It’s meant for the specific purpose of giving someone a solid foundation for any given consoles library. I chose games based on critical reception, popularity, cultural significance, industry impact, exclusivity, and uniqueness. This means that a lot of essential and classic games get left out, but it’s also WIP so any feedback is appreciated! Especially any of those true retro platforms that some people might be super invested in! It’s the reason I’m posting after all.

Also, if this is not an appropriate subreddit I will delete! I’m just looking for places that allow general games discussion posts.

gaming,1llxz6u,"I host a bunch of game wikis (OSRS, Minecraft) that got way better when they escaped from Fandom's terrible platform. What other wikis do you wish could get away?","Hey /r/gaming! I help run [Weird Gloop](https://weirdgloop.org), which is a group of RuneScape wiki nerds that specializes in un-enshittifying wikis by getting them away from Fandom’s insanely bad ad experience, and giving control back to the wiki editors that are actually doing all the work.

We started off in 2018 by moving the RuneScape/OSRS wikis to [runescape.wiki](https://runescape.wiki), which became (afaik) the first wiki fork to overwhelmingly beat out the abandoned Fandom version on Google. [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki) followed about 2 years ago, and since then we've been doing a bunch of official wikis ([League of Legends](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com), [Warframe](https://wiki.warframe.com), [Vampire Survivors](https://vampire.survivors.wiki)) directly with the game developers (surprise, game devs don't like the Fandom ads anymore than you do…)

Even putting aside the dogshit ads, it's crazy just how much **better** all of those wikis got after they moved away from Fandom. The quality of the actual wiki content goes up in a noticeable, measurable way ([here](https://weirdgloop.org/blog/why-were-helping-more-wikis-move-away-from-fandom#why-ditching-fandom-is-cool-and-based)'s some fun graphs), because more people show up and want to help, when they feel like they're contributing to something that isn't taking advantage of them.

A bunch of the wikis we ended up hosting got the ball rolling because of people on game subreddits venting about Fandom ([here](https://reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1ixysva/discussion_on_changing_wiki_hosts_away_from_fandom/)’s a conversation on /r/balatro, which launched at [balatrowiki.org](https://balatrowiki.org) just last week). So I thought it might be a good idea to just ask people here: **what wikis are currently stuck on Fandom that you wish could get out?**

gaming,1llpxm9,Ok hear me out. Are there any full releases that have management gameplay similar to Umamusume?,"I feel the need to preface this post with the following statement. The premise of Umamusume is absurd and goofy af. That said, the game does a shit ton of stuff right, and I'm looking for a full title that can scratch the same itch because I've legitimately never really played anything like this before.

So I started playing Umamusume on a whim because I saw a video of their race presentation and it seemed pretty fun to drop in casually. Little did I realize getting into it that the game has what is actually an insanely deep management sim with a shit ton of build possibilities. Unfortunately the depth of the game is pretty strongly gated behind gacha and grinding is gated behind stamina systems as well.

The overall gameplay is actually fun and rewarding enough for me to want a full title with the same gameppay loop. It's a roguelike training sim. The way it works is that you pick a horse to start a run with and you out them through the training system with specific deadlines at which you need to perform in races in order to continue the run and ultimately become the horse race champion. Yes it's absurd, but it's weirdly addicting. 

The training options you have are static, but their outcomes can be effected by a deck of support cards that randomly cause certain events to occur that offer boosts and unlock new skills to learn. When a run ends either in failure or in triumph, you're given a token that represents the horse you trained that is then able to pass on skills and attributes to the next horse you want to start a run with. You will ultimately have two generations of horses, grandparents, and parents, that all contribute to your ""ultimate horse"" and that horse can just continue being used when you generate new horses. It is literally a horse breeding system.

I have become obsessed with Umamusume, but all the gacha elements of the game prevent me from being able to play it on my terms so now I'm desperately looking for an actually standalone game that offers something similar. Please help. It doesn't have to be about horses and it doesn't have to have anime visuals.

* Video game adaptation of a board game that eventually led to a 9-book series
   * 6 are currently available, the other 3 coming soon.
   * Stories are similar to Pixar / Dreamwork films: aimed at kids, but also enjoyable for older readers
* Developed by French-Canadian indie studio RuniQ
   * The original series is also French-Canadian.
* Currently available on Steam, with a Switch version possibly coming in September, according to the devs
* Both **coop**erative and **comp**etitive multiplayer, with challenges, races, survival, all with items to hamper your opponents
* The characters can transform into dragons, with powerful breath weapons and screen-clearing attacks
* Slight RPG elements, with equipable items
* 4 characters to start with, 4 others to come in the future
   * Personally, that's a *little* annoying, because the splash art shows all 8 Heroes.
   * It could be to avoid spoiling the books.

From that point on, the difficulty definitely ramps up. Not sure if it’s just my inexperience or misunderstanding how some abilities work but I actually lost a fighter even on Easy Challenge. Guess that’s the game being fair, not kind.

After playing for a while, you start getting used to it and stop making those critical mistakes that cost you the whole squad.

Feels like it’s all part of the learning curve, frustrating at first, but eventually you get the hang of it.

Visually, the game looks ok, it has a solid pixel-art style, and the character portraits look sharp. The 3D stylization of units on arena also fits the aesthetic well.

As for combat depth, it’s still early to speak for every part of combat system, but so far it feels like most abilities are actually useful. With smart planning and proper use of skills, you can get through harder challenges without taking too much damage.

Demo is worth trying out if you like turn based tactical genre, but if you dont want to play in slow pace - that can be frustrating.",129,7,1750950716.0,,0.86,False,False,Yawaworoht1470,https://i.redd.it/uzpnac63ea9f1.png,new,low

gaming,1lkoz9i,Expedition 33 impressions after beating the game,"I knew I was going to like it because P5 is my fav game and I really enjoy rhythm games. The game is overhyped to the moon, thing happened to me playing Nier Automata, I expected it to be perfect and I hated many things like pacing and how it wasted your time but it still leaves a lot to interpret.

Now for Expedition 33, you can see it's not a perfect game in the first hour by the exploration or gameplay outside fights and cinematics but it doesn't waste your time, the pacing is really fast, maybe too fast jumping from one place to another. 

About the gameplay, I see the limitations in doing repetitive things, getting your skill rotation just right without having to heal, but I also see the insane potential with finding Pictos, leveling up certain skills that are insane, for example:

I come from Persona where you can hyper buff someone (+Atk, passives to deal +75% damage, double damage ability, less defense on enemy, weaknesses, severe magic damage or physical multi-hits)

And now on this game you tell me I can stack up Virtuous Stance 200% dmg, inverse that doubles damage, First strike extra damage, Immolate: not being hit extra damage, +15% from powerful, greater defenseless on enemy, and Maelle 9cost skill multi-hits but damage crits deal double damage, and then Sciel can double that damage too, I was able to deal 250k damage in one hit on my first playthrough damn, I didn't even grind or go out of my way to explore other places, I just spent too much time thinking stuff.

Playing on Extreme the game asks for almost perfection, dying in 1-4 hits you have to learn the timings for parries, I love rhythm games and this is kinda like that.

As for the story its super confusing until the end, but I respect the ballsy move, and they wanted to tell a story of grief and loss and also explain the science fiction in an emotional way, and this is the way. Emotional science fiction is the way, that's what I love about og Sephiroth compared to newer one in remakes, emotionally grounded science fiction.

The music was alright sometimes and others it was absolutely perfect and insane.

The pacing, locations, enemy types, weapons, music, etc. were really fun, nice looking, and really helped set the tone, although.....ALTHOUGH...XEN to Nihilanth made me want to tear my hair out. Keep in mind, visually OUTSTANDING levels and areas, more cool enemies, but I ran into loads of bugs, and apparently these bugs are known by everyone, and I had to spend so long on those chapters, that it kind of.....I don't want to say ruined the end of the game or last half, but....it certainly made it more repetitive, and more of a chore.

gaming,1lkohut,What game gave you the most of wonderment in your life?,"For me two answers come to mind The first Halo and Zelda:OOT

For Halo just landing on the ring world was awe inspiring. This was a level that didn't try to funnel you down a cooridor, but instead gave you an entire world to roam around in with you having to get to get to the middle of the structure in the middle to complete the level. 

I've told this story before but when I first got to it, ilI just started walking in more or less straight line, only to be killed cause I was sniped by a Grunt. I had played Mario 64 and I was a Nintendo 64 kid so 3D worlds were nothing new to me, but Halo made me rethink everything I knew about 3D.

gaming,1lke78m,Help me find joy in gaming again? Mid 30-year-old who has lost the spark.,"I don’t know how often this happens to others or is talked about. If the love of video games diminishes over time. 

I remember unboxing my Gameboy and Nintendo in the 1990s. When Halo came out, I sold my PS2 so I could get an Xbox and play Halo. After I’d buy a new video game at the store, I’d read the booklet cover to cover on the way home. 

Through many hardships, like when I got leukemia at 25-years-old, video games were always an escape. Even in the worst moments, getting online would make the day a bit better. 

Some of my best memories include playing League of Legends with all my closest friends, jammed into one dorm room in college. Or trying to unlock armor on Halo Reach. Leveling up my Enhance Shaman during Lich King. And getting Taco Bell with the guys and waiting at GameStop for a midnight release. Building my first PC. Oh, LAN parties. I’d do anything for one more night of Halo 3 with the boys. 

Now, I can’t find a game (other than Balatro) that will hold my attention. I either bore instantly, do not have any joy, or lack any desire to play anything.

I have a wife and kid I love (another coming in August). My job is kinda demanding and I don’t have a ton of free time. 

Maybe this is growing up. I don’t know. 

TL;DR: I can’t tell why I’m losing my desire to play video games. If this is normal for millennials as they get older, or if it’s just something specific to me. 

It’s like a loss of identity in a way. Not that I need to have video games in my life, I just miss the joy they used to bring me. 

Anyone else go through this or find a way to relight the spark?

gaming,1lk3dxk,Don't sleep on DeathStranding 2.,"Just started yesterday and I'm just completely blown away. The game is still largely about delivering items and connecting areas to the Chiral network but the gameplay and story wrapped around it is just so refreshing. 
It also helps that the graphics are some of the best I've seen thanks to the Decimal engine. Same engine used in Horizon Forbidden West. 
Completely blew me away on the OLED display. 

I've also noticed just how masterful Kojima is in crafting the overall experience. Each mission I've played so far felt like a proper handcrafted experience. You get the feeling they play tested the hell out of each mission to ensure they play out not only fun but also keeps players interest/intrigue. First mission I did, had to cut through a bandit camp , ( which this time was more exciting compare to the first game, thanks to the additional combat methods this time around ), only to be completely outnumbered so I had to make a run for it out of there but once I got clear a random sandstorm happens with lighting bolts hitting close to me left and right the whole way through. It was quite the gaming experience and the joy I felt finally getting to my destination was immersurable I'll tell you that. 

In terms of gameplay it's overall quite pleasing to play as well. Performance is solid. I have it running on quality mode on my base PS5 there and I have no complaints. 

Can't wait to dive in some more later after work! 

Early on in the year but already a strong contender for GOTY.

gaming,1ljt0ms,How gaming has evolved over time (discussion),"This has been something I've been thinking about recently and I really want to hear some of your opinions.

So basically, over time, gaming has evolved in many ways, but **the change I want to discuss is the ratio between the increasing quality of games, and the increasing time windows that we now have to wait between games.**

Games have significantly more content than they used to, and the standards of quality have increased exponentially. On the other hand, the release windows for games has also increased many times over what it used to be.

I mean I just remember being a kid and it felt like we would get new big name games like practically every year. 

Now I'm coming to grips with the fact that the next new elder scrolls game I play might be my last (I'm joking but only a little bit). And how does this effect the process? I imagine the team working on the game would probably change over such a long period, does this cause any kind of issues with the original vision for a game being lost?

On the other hand, and this is coming from a retro gamer, metroid just isn't close to as fun and red dead redemption 2. 

And there technically are plenty of games available and being made, but many of these can be from little known indy developers, and while I'd encourage everyone to give a new dev a chance, I also get not wanting to sink money in something that isn't a sure thing in terms of enjoyability. 

There are technically more games than there used to be, but the big AAA games take like 4-8 Years to make these days. 

What are everyone's thoughts on this?

**Does the quality increase of modern games justify the long waiting period between games ?**

If you've ever wanted to see Elden Ring described in these perspectives, this post is for you. References to in-game dialogue, item descriptions, and academic work are included. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. 

  


Elden Ring (2022) is my favourite game of all time, and Shadow of the Erdtree (2024) is my favourite DLC of all time. While many emphasize the combat and vast open world, my love for Elden Ring centres on its lore, psychological depth, philosophical underpinnings, and sociological structures. To me, Elden Ring is not merely a game but a platform for examining complex psychological, philosophical, and sociological issues.

**Philosophy: Order, Chaos, and the Search for Meaning**

The story of Elden Ring revolves around the eponymous Elden Ring and its shattering. More than a mere metaphor, the Elden Ring is a physical manifestation of cosmic law and order. Marika's fracturing of the ring represents an act of deconstruction that destabilizes the Lands Between. The conflict among her demigod children showcases how any governing system, no matter how perfect its proponents believe it to be, is influenced by subjective interpretations and conflicts of interest. The shattering of the Elden Ring can thus be seen as a symbol for the ever-increasing tension between the desire for stability and structure and the chaotic, transformative forces beneath the surface. Miquella adds a crucial layer to this dynamic, as the Age of Compassion, where everyone is welcome and not discriminated against \[1\], starkly contrasts the rigid status quo of the Golden Order \[2, 3\] and the destructive Frenzied Flame. In opposition to Miquella's vision, the Frenzied Flame offers a nihilistic outlook: a desire to return to primordial existence through universal immolation to end the suffering, chaos, and despair that inhabit The Lands Between \[4\]. Such an approach of absolute destruction raises questions about this response to profound despair, while Ranni's Age of Stars raises questions about reforming and reimagining fractured and broken worlds \[5\]

Throughout Elden Ring, many different groups have competing ideals that strongly harken back to Nietzsche and the concept of Will to Power (Deleuze, 2006). This is not merely about brute force; it is the fundamental drive to overcome, create, and define values within the world. The Golden Order, the Frenzied Flame, Ranni, and Miquella each represent a unique view on what the proper ""order"" in the world should look like, and each embodies a distinct manifestation of this will. The Golden Order asserts its dominance mainly by physical force, declaring its tenets universal law while suppressing dissenters, their beliefs, and their history (Nietzsche, 2006). The Frenzied Flame, by contrast, seeks to burn everything back into a primordial state.

The Tarnished, an outcast rescued and guided by Grace, explores this broken world. However, this guidance does not diminish player agency; instead, it frames it, as the Tarnished retains complete autonomy over their actions, including which age to usher in. The Lands Between is filled with decay, rotting corpses, unburied horrors, and an oppressive past, all of which force the player to find meaning in what is initially seen as a meaningless world devoid of truth. In this world, old truths have shattered, and purpose is absent. The Tarnished's choice to create or reject a new order echoes the work of Jean-Paul Sartre and his concept of radical freedom (Sartre, 2007). Sartre suggested that humans are fundamentally free, born without a predestined purpose; we can say, think, feel, and do whatever we desire. For him, existence precedes essence; our identity and what we take meaning in are not predetermined or given to us; we make them via our choices.

This lack of a predestined path shows that humans are solely responsible for their choices, not as punishment, but as a recognition that there is no such thing as absolute right or wrong, and no escape from choice; even choosing not to choose is a choice. Because there is no inherent right or wrong, the individual becomes the source of their values, not the external world. Such freedom, of course, carries with it a heavy burden, as each choice carries an intense weight. Sartre (2007) identified three emotional consequences of this absolute freedom: anguish, where anxiety arises from having such freedom and responsibility; forlornness, the isolation that comes with these choices, as we are the meaning-makers; and despair, the fact that the only actions we can rely on are our own, as we lack control over external events and the actions of others. As a largely blank slate for the player, the Tarnished perfectly embodies this existential journey, as the player's choices define their essence.

The Tarnished can themselves be viewed through a philosophical lens. Through insurmountable odds, seemingly endless challenges, and making choices in a meaningless world, the Tarnished can represent the absurd hero (Camus, 1991), who finds dignity and purpose in rebellion against meaninglessness. The Tarnished's existence and their choices as they persevere against all odds are an act of defiance against the notion of meaninglessness.

The game also explores the ethics of power and choice. Each ending the player can choose is not merely an option for a trophy; it represents an ethical stance on what should happen to the Lands Between and can encourage the player to consider their choice. The Age of Fracture mends the Elden Ring, and the Golden Order remains steadfast, as does the status quo. In contrast, the Frenzied Flame offers absolute destruction. However, its moral standing is ambiguous: is it truly nihilistic, or is it an act of mercy intended to end a cycle of profound suffering? These questions and the possible endings challenge players to confront their moral compass.

Queen Marika's removal of the Rune of Death \[6\] raises specific questions. If existence is constant and devoid of death, what worth can be ascribed to life, experience, and suffering? The constant respawning of weaker foes underscores the notion that immortality, when devoid of purpose and evolution, can be a curse rather than a blessing, leading to stagnation, decay, and a loss of meaning in existence itself.

Finally, the Outer Gods introduce the nature of divinity. Powers such as the God of Rot and the Formless Mother often influence and manipulate those in the Lands Between \[7\], rendering them pawns in a game they do not understand, with rules and stakes they cannot even begin to recognize. The Outer Gods bring about questions of free will, determinism, and the agency one has when faced with divine wills. Elden Ring is about cycles, reprisals, decay, and potential rebirth. The Golden Order perpetuates a cycle of dominance that resists change. In contrast, Ranni's Age of Stars signifies a profound yearning for rupture, change, and an end to this stagnant cycle, a breaking from the cycle of suffering. The Tarnished's choice is personal and represents whether the world will be trapped in an endless cycle or reborn.

**Psychology: Scars of Trauma and the Grip of Obsession**

The Lands Between is a traumatized space; The Shattering represents not merely an event in time, but an active, open wound: an ongoing trauma that refuses to heal, deeply scarring the land (van der Kolk, 2014). Players can see the warfare and sense immense decay as the land continually relives its trauma, evoking the psychological aftermath over the Lands. Likewise, the Land of Shadow can be seen as a repressed collective trauma due to Marika casting a veil over it, effectively causing it to be forgotten, mirroring how societies can repress painful memories to cope with overwhelming events.

Elden Ring features numerous groups bound by obsessive fanaticism and a unique response to a broken world. Nowhere is this more apparent than within The Golden Order, with their cognitive rigidity and confirmation bias, where belief systems become exclusionary and resistant to differing views on truth. Furthermore, many within the Order engage in cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957), staunchly adhering to the Order's decaying tenets and refusing to question how such a perfect order could have made the world so broken.

Lineage, parental actions, expectations, and the confronting failures of previous generations also shape the lives of many characters. Miquella, for instance, strives to create an Age of Compassion, seeking to transcend the Golden Order's limitations and build a perfect system for those rejected by the Erdtree and to atone for the harm of his mother \[8\]. Ranni, who was supposed to be the next Carian Queen, renounces her role as future queen \[9\] in favour of the Age of Stars, actively defining her destiny apart from her inherited expectations.

Elden Ring also employs Jungian archetypes extensively (Jung, 1968a; 1968b). Marika, for example, embodies the great mother and the shadow as she shattered the Elden Ring. Radagon, in contrast, may serve as a fragmented aspect of the self. The Erdtree can represent a World Tree, a symbol of totality and connection. Understanding such symbols can enhance the depth of understanding of Elden Ring and showcase universal collective unconscious patterns within the game (Bean, 2023). Elden Ring also showcases how hubris and ambition can lead to ruin. Marika's children are driven to claim the Elden Ring for themselves. However, this leads to a ceaseless war characterized by madness and horrible transformations (physical, mental, and emotional), with Radahn being perhaps the most well-known casualty as the scarlet rot afflicted him and drove him to madness \[10\]. Morgott is a tragic victim, fanatically devoted to an Order that rejected him \[11\].

**Sociology: Power Dynamics, Hierarchy, Control, and Feminism**

Elden Ring presents a complex interplay of power dynamics, religious hegemony, and social stratification with a distinct social hierarchy. Marika and her children are at the apex, while beings such as the Omens are at the bottom. Structurally, this hierarchy is also evident. Compare the beautiful capital city of Leyndell with the numerous dilapidated villages scattered throughout, along with the wretched underground beneath the capital; the game emphasizes heavy social exclusion based on unchosen characteristics. For example, Omens, when born, either have their horns removed as infants, a process that many do not survive \[12\] or are confined deep underground \[13\]. The Omens undergo a form of eugenics based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority. Ostracization and persecution are perhaps nowhere better exemplified than in Those Who Live in Death; the Golden Order considers their entire existence an affront to the Order's ideology of life, death, and rebirth \[14\], showing that those who defy prevailing ideological norms will be subject to active persecution and social ostracism.

The Golden Order is not merely a religious doctrine to be passively followed; it is also a force that has asserted its dominance all across the land through conquest and assimilation. The Order and its beliefs are rigid and unwilling to tolerate differing faiths and cultures to preserve and control what they view as accurate. Examples of these conquests and assimilations include the Fire Giants, whom the Order viewed as a threat \[15\] and, as a final act of humiliation, forced one last Fire Giant to guard the flame that could burn the Erdtree \[16\]. In a more subtle form of cultural assimilation, the Golden Order had Radagon wed Rennala, ending the Liurnian War through marriage rather than destruction \[17, 18\].

The theories of Michel Foucault (1990, 1995) can also be applied to Elden Ring's concept of power, specifically how it intertwines with knowledge and discourse. The Golden Order does not simply maintain control via military might; it controls what is considered truth and history, normalizing certain behaviours while forbidding and punishing others. Again, turning to the Omens, who were harmed and segregated based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority, reflects Foucault's ideas on how power structures create and enforce norms via exclusion and discipline, and how those in power use more than force to bend and shape minds and bodies by shaping the very reality of what is acceptable and what is not.

Elden Ring also has a strong focus on determinism vs. free will. Framing events as predetermined and predestined might seem to dissuade action. However, the player's choices to defy or fulfil these prophecies comment on an individual's ability to break from (or continue) societal expectations (Bogost, 2007; Rendle & Pasternack, 2025). The game's narrative often presents prophecies, yet the agency given to the Tarnished allows for the subversion or affirmation of these preordained paths, making the player's interaction with destiny a key theme.

Beyond the Omens (discussed extensively), the game shows other systematic subjugation with the Albinaurics, who were created by human hands \[19\] and persecuted by the Knights of the Cuckoos for their defiled blood \[20\]. Albinaurics mirror historical patterns of social subjection based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority and are used only for their utility (Du Bois, 1994; Marx & Engels, 2002). Even the last Fire Giant's forced humiliation is an act of prolonged psychological and social subjugation from the Golden Order.

Finally, the Shattering left the Lands Between in a stagnant, violent cycle with seemingly no end. Even after the death of certain demigods, many of their forces remain, and the repercussions, abetted by the unburied dead and decaying lands, are omnipresent. Such a portrayal represents a view of the sociological aftermath of systemic conflict. Even after authorities collapse, societies can become trapped in cycles of conflict and decay, and the Tarnished can often find themselves as mere pawns, mirroring the fact that so many people can become engaged in conflict with profound and ambiguous consequences.

**Feminism in Elden Ring**

Like many other FromSoft games, Elden Ring is rich in feminist interpretations, featuring many excellent and strong female characters (or female-presenting characters) who wield tremendous power and significance. Queen Marika herself is the central figure in Elden Ring. While strong, she also possesses a degree of suffering and entrapment \[21\]. Ranni the Witch actively rejects her role and seeks to establish a new order free from the influence of the Outer Gods. Her desire for autonomy and self-determination is central to much feminist literature. Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is an incredible warrior whose prowess with a blade is unmatched \[22\], even with her scarlet rot; this serves as a testament to her resilience and determination. Melina is another central character who serves as a guide for the player. Initially seeking to make it to the Erdtree to understand the purpose given to her by her mother \[23\], Melina eventually gains agency and volition in forging her own path, refusing the purpose her mother gave her \[24, 25\].

Even Miquella, another Empyrean, is presented with a feminine appearance and manner. His perpetually young \[26\] and feminine form starkly contrasts with the rugged, imposing physiques of the other male demigods, such as Godfrey, Godrick, and especially Radahn. His youthful, feminine appearance is complemented by his gentle demeanour and goal of creating an age based on compassion and inclusion rather than using brute force. Miquella's quest contrasts traditional, often aggressive displays of power by men, showcasing that influence in the Lands Between is not simply tied to conventional masculinity and acts of violence and war. Elden Ring features matrilineal societies: women hold significant power as Gods, queens, leaders, and Empyreans, and leaders (e.g., Queen Marika, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, Lunar Princess Ranni, Gloam-Eyed Queen, Malenia, Blade of Miquella, Hornsent Grandam). One striking observation is that all the candidates for Godhood were either female (Ranni, Malenia, Marika, Gloam-Eyed Queen) or appeared as feminine in appearance and mannerisms (Miquella, who is a stark contrast to every other male demigod). To me, this suggests a fundamental connection between femininity and divine power. The stories of Marika, Ranni, Melina, and Miquella touch upon themes of autonomy and the fight against the predetermined. For example, Ranni sheds her body to escape her fate, and Melina, having finally found her purpose, lights herself aflame in an act of agency.

Elden Ring may not be overtly ""in your face"" with feminism like other games, but there is plenty here for rich feminist interpretations. The game showcases a world with powerful women and feminine characters central to the story, whose struggles revolve around agency, fighting against external control, and challenging destiny.

Elden Ring is a work of art in every sense of the word. It is a rich and fertile ground for academics to explore complex themes of philosophy (such as discussing order, chaos, meaning, radical freedom and the will to stop various warring factions while creating meaning from the meaningless), psychology (how the world of Elden Ring is an open-world deeply scarred by past and ongoing trauma as the many inhabitants contend with obsession, cognitive dissonance, and generational burdens all while embodying various archetypes that resonate with the collective unconscious of the world), and sociology (as it presents a world filled with power dynamics, social stratification, and the torment of marginalized groups, offering an example of Foucauldian power structures and the persistent cycles of conflict and control). Finally, the game stands out for its strong feminist undertones as it presents strong female and feminine-presenting characters who actively (rather than passively) defy traditional tropes and champion themes of agency, autonomy, and self-determination. As I said at the start, Elden Ring is my favourite game of all time, and the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is my favourite DLC of all time; each is a work of art that asks the player to deeply explore a narrative that challenges preconceived notions and beliefs while providing insight into the human condition and ethical thought.

gaming,1ljbfpy,Finding Beauty in Terror: Eroguro in Silent Hill f.,"Silent Hill f is the game I am most excited for this year; I even bought the deluxe edition for $27 because I saved up PS Stars points for nearly two years just for this game. Since the initial trailer, I have been fixated on the concept of eroguro and its connection to the game. Having been in post-secondary for the last eight years, I wrote a small academic paper on the connection between eroguro and Silent Hill f.  I hope you love reading it as much as I loved writing it.

**Blossoming Horror: The** ***Eroguro*** **Influence in** ***Silent Hill f***

The serene Japanese village of Ebisugaoka in *Silent Hill f* undergoes a disturbing transformation into blossoming horror, marking a profound and fascinating departure for the acclaimed franchise. Unveiled in 2022, *Silent Hill f* quickly garnered significant attention from fans due to its notable shift from the traditional American Midwest setting to 1960s rural Japan. The game’s debut trailer presented a striking blend of rustic aesthetics intertwined with profound horrors, indicating a marked departure from an industrial American ideal. Instead, the game favours a framework heavily rooted in *eroguro*. The presence of parasitic flora and fauna, the disintegration of a young schoolgirl's innocence, and the unsettling juxtaposition of beauty with decay are pivotal. The game employs an *eroguro* framework to forge a psychologically distinct horror experience, aiming to instill fear in players by delving into the beauty within the grotesque.

**A Shift in Aesthetic and Narrative**

The *Silent Hill* franchise is characteristically defined by elements like rust, fog, industrial decay, and monsters influenced by Freudian concepts. These elements are evident from the dilapidated titular town in *Silent Hill* to the confined apartment of *Silent Hill 4: The Room*. However, *Silent Hill f* represents a notable departure in its narrative and aesthetic framework. It transitions from an industrial context to a rural Japanese village, introducing monsters embodying a paradoxical blend of beauty and horror. This shift transcends mere visual changes; it signals a significant evolution in artistic direction. This evolution is deeply rooted in the influences of *eroguro*. Silverberg (2007) states that *eroguro* constitutes a distinct genre within Japanese art. To fully understand its applicability to the game, we must deconstruct its three core components: the erotic, the grotesque, and the nonsensical. Individually, these themes define *eroguro's* unique characteristics. When combined, however, their true and unsettling nature takes shape.

**The Three Pillars of** ***Eroguro***

(1) Ero (Erotic)

Erotic transcends mere explicit sexuality; it encapsulates notions of sensuality, allure, beauty, and elements perceived as desirable. The trailers showcase a lush, beautiful, quiet life, initially displaying traditional Japanese architecture among hills, rice fields, and village streets. Such imagery often features young schoolgirls, who embody purity and tranquillity.

However, by the end of the trailer, this lush beauty becomes nightmarish. Plants bloom from humans, entangle bodies, and consume buildings. This transformation from something beautiful into something horrific mirrors the perversion of the desirable. What was once captivating becomes deeply unsettling, and the serene, picturesque village becomes ominous and distorted.

(2) Guro (Grotesque)

The grotesque does not solely denote gore and violence. Instead, it signifies deformations, disturbances, and unsettling perversions of form and function. It evokes a sense of inherent wrongness or corruption that starkly contrasts with what one might typically consider beautiful, ordinary, or innocent. We easily see this element in the monsters, especially the flower girl from the first trailer.

(3) Nonsense

Nonsense pertains to surrealism, absurdity, and illogical constructs often accompanying the genre's disturbing essence. This element encompasses dreamlike states, abrupt transformations, and narratives that resist rational interpretation, engendering cognitive dissonance and discomfort. We can see this element in the village; the fog and flowers consuming Ebisugaoka transform the small, quiet town into a surreal and illogical nightmare.

**Provocative Themes and Historical Context**

The confluence of these three elements interrogates various provocative themes. These include beauty, decay, attraction, repulsion, depravity, perversion, and the darker, often taboo dimensions of human desire. The resultant discomfort may emanate not solely from visual and thematic representations of bodies, but also from the disquietude of societal norms and psychological states.

This art style reached its zenith during the Taishō (1912-1926) and early Shōwa eras (1927-1945). Westernization, banning erotic art, warfare, industrialization, urban anxieties, such as class divide, social dislocation, economic instability, cultural clashes, and the subsequent American occupation characterized these periods (Gordon, 2019). These multifaceted factors contributed to the emergence of artistic expressions that, despite restrictive circumstances, subverted traditional norms. While eroguro had its apex in the Taishō and early Shōwa era, it was suppressed during World War II, only to reemerge after the war and influence entertainment like music and manga (McLelland, 2006).

**Deconstructing Horror Through** ***Eroguro***

By employing an analytical lens focused on aesthetic and cultural transformations in this game through the prism of *eroguro*, we can adeptly deconstruct its distinctive approach to horror. This approach is intricately woven into the complex fabric of Japanese cultural narratives, belief systems, historical contexts, and aesthetic principles.

A fundamental principle within the *eroguro* genre is the juxtaposition of beauty and the grotesque. The horror manifests not merely through the monstrosities encountered by the player but rather in the degradation of what is conventionally perceived as beautiful. The trailers for this game effectively illustrate this principle. They present an idyllic village characterized by a picturesque landscape, traditional Japanese architecture, and a young schoolgirl.

However, this perception of beauty is systematically subverted as a red spider lily (*Lycoris radiata*) begins to overrun the village. These flowers, known as higanbana, are frequently found near graveyards and are deeply associated with themes of death and the afterlife in Buddhist contexts. The game employs these flowers as agents, initiating a transition from aesthetic beauty to the grotesque. A youthful girl blooming with these beautiful flowers appears in the inaugural trailer; she embodies a duality, being both a monster and an object of beauty.

**Symbolism and Psychological Depth**

In Japan, young girls serve as a compelling symbol within cultural discourse. They exist in various states that straddle the lines of innocence (a stark contrast to the horror engulfing the village) and burgeoning sexuality. This duality positions them as significant vessels for exploring themes such as corruption, guilt, shame, fear, and repression. The 1960s in Japan were marked by profound upheaval (Gordon, 2019), during which traditional values encountered the challenges posed by modern and increasingly liberal ideologies. Consequently, young women faced intense societal pressure to adhere to ascribed roles.

Under the framework of *eroguro*, the horrors depicted can therefore be argued to be not merely external manifestations, but an internal horror projected outward. The game's writer, Ryukishi07, powerfully demonstrates this tradition of using innocent-presenting characters to explore deep psychological turmoil. In his celebrated Higurashi: When They Cry series, he masterfully juxtaposes extreme trauma and brutal violence in a serene village setting with moé, an aesthetic built on attraction and affection for cute fictional characters (Galbraith, 2014), which can include a desire to protect them (Galbraith, 2009).

Ryukishi07’s involvement strongly suggests that the imagery of flowers in the game could symbolize trauma, guilt, repressed memories, forbidden desires, or the overwhelming social pressure to conform, ultimately blossoming into a grotesque beauty. Such themes resonate with a fundamental aspect of *Silent Hill*: the psychological terrain made manifest, yet now interpreted through a distinctly Japanese cultural and aesthetic lens articulated by *eroguro*.

**A New Frontier for Horror**

By integrating the concept of *eroguro*, *Silent Hill f* is positioned to offer an exceptionally unsettling horror experience. This experience creates unease and repulsion, inducing a perverse interpretation of beauty and transgressing various social taboos. The dynamic interplay between beauty and horror will likely make a distressing narrative as the environments and monsters fuse these elements. This fusion will create a strong sense of discomfort and psychological unease. Critically, the *eroguro* framework allows the title to present the multifaceted concept of *eroguro* to a broader audience, showcasing that perhaps the most profound terror may be hidden in what we consider beautiful, allowing for a critical reassessment of what horror and beauty truly mean.

movies,1lzi1pl,The Prestige theory: Angier dies TWICE each show.,"It occurred to me tonight as having watched this remarkable film for the dozenth or so time.  
The idea is that the intention of Angier's ""water escape"" in *The REAL Transported Man* is to actually drown the same way as his wife, yet to pass it off like he has escaped.   
You know earlier in the story when Angier tries to drown himself (or at least fathom Julia's experience)?   
That seems to be a foreshadowing that he will attempt to honor her death by experiencing it EVERY show.  
Obviously that's no surprise because he clearly drowns every show when he falls into the enclosure as part of his Transported act, but I think he already does that earlier on in the show because he can't rely on previously seen tricks and executing them in such fashion with only his final act being something special.  
Not to mention he doesn't want anyone with sight to be able to assist him with his tricks so I think he's also taking advantage of that by being his own help throughout the night. Possibly as someone in disguise backstage that takes the Prestige after the (alleged) escape.

It makes complete sense that Angier uses the machine for as many tricks as he can, before bowing out the evening with his ""Transported Man"" finale. To push a little further, I'd even go so far as to say that EVERY trick in the show takes advantage of Tesla's invention. It's part of his hubris.   
And it's that undying hubris which kills both *Freddy Borden,* followed by *Lord Caldlow* himself.  
Had both left the other to their own devices then they'd have both survived and parted ways in peace.

Angier is the *Albert Borden* equivalent to Lord Caldlow's identity. The budding magician who falls in love and loses his wife.  
The passionate ego must die. To add one final irrelevant point to this post, I really enjoy the very last shot of the film serving as a hidden metaphor that Angier is alive. Almost as if the equivalent that happened to Albert.   
Caldlow is dead, so that Angier can live a full life.  
  
It's a detail that I'm piecing together as I assume Cutter's line about us wanting to be fooled actually means something as the shot lingers on the corpse: *There is still more to the story.*",1,0,1752485855.0,Discussion,1.0,True,False,Lonely_Werewolf_3667,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lzi1pl/the_prestige_theory_angier_dies_twice_each_show/,new,low

Still, you could see his interactions Meredith as part of his 'Dickie' act, or possibly that he's such a habitual liar and chameleon that he slips into whatever role is most convenient.  His relationship to Dickie straddles this line often as his obsession consumes him but whether this jealous infatuation is with Dickie himself or just his lifestyle is up for interpretation.

First off, I thought the CGI was steller. And I'm not a fan of CGI these days. I blame too many cgi movies being afraid to commit to shadows and enviromental effects. (Eg. Jack Schneider's Justice League vs. Wicked).

It's refreshing to see a company willing to commit to darker cgi tones, including shadows and sunsets.

But, the first 2/3rds of the movie felt disjointed at times, and at other times.. a few times, it felt derivitive, especially with Godzilla going on a spree to increase his power.

Pros: has a few feel good scenes  plus the awesome ending scene.

The final fight, which in all honesty, the first 2/3rds of the film was working toward... absolutly steller.

Today is Cambodia.

Our fifth day winner, from Brunei, is **Travellers and Magicians (2003) directed by Khyentse Norbu.** It was the first feature film shot entirely in Bhutan. 

Okay let's do **Cambodia.**

It is located in southeast Asia. With such an ancient and rich history of Buddhism, as well as, being notable for adopting full communism in he 70s under the brutal Pol Pot regime. With as much history as Cambodia, I am hoping for some great film suggestions that capture the rich culture and identity of this country. I can also imagine there's plenty of great English language movies set in the jungles of Cambodia.

The rules:

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

Jaws is another that's well-known for it's incredibly tough shoot. Especially in regards to shooting the Orca scenes in the ocean, and the frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark. Which of course led to one of the film's greatest strengths as the shark's presence was instead psychologically suggested rather than shown, which made the shark's more numerous appearances during the third act that much more impactful when you hadn't seen too much of it up to that point and by then were so invested in the story and characters.

Was the Cinderella character, I think her name was Agnes, supposed to be portrayed as being evil/antagonist? I was chatting with other people on TikTok about the movie and it seems like the general consensus is that this was a movie where they reverse the roles as the step sister being a victim and Cinderella being a perpetrator.

In my view they were both victims, more so Agnes. She had her life ripped from her, watched her father decompose, was pushed into poverty, and was severely abused. She then positioned herself to marry the prince to escape her situation. Nothing about her actions or motives seems callous and instead seems very reasonable. Although I feel for Elvira too and wanted a happier ending for her, I was happy for Agnes ending. I was rooting her being the protagonist the entire time and Elvira being a complicated antagonist.

In back-to-back scenes he learns that Memnet died because she was going to tell the pharaoh that Moses was born to a Hebrew mother, and hears it from his mother’s mouth that he is truly Hebrew. 

Prior to these scenes Moses was fully on board with Egypt and its institution of slavery. He used an army of slaves to build the pharaoh’s treasure city; after which the pharaoh named Moses his successor. But on the word of two Hebrew slaves who say that he is one of them, he renounces everything, voluntarily goes to work in the pits where they make the mud for bricks, and when Rameses brings him before the pharaoh in chains tells him that he would lead the Hebrews in revolt against him if he could. 

As the audience we know where Moses came from and where he’s going, but the character at the time doesn’t. Not really. It just seems like he made a massive character shift on not a lot of evidence and after very little time to consider it. He knows Rameses wants the throne back.

movies,1lz1v01,Ulysses (1954) - The great major adaptation of The Odyssey,"https://reddit.com/link/1lz1v01/video/nx517uxe0pcf1/player

Unlike the Iliad, which has never had good adaptations, the movie Troy with Brad Pitt was the worst of all, functioning as a fanfic of Homer's classic. The Odyssey, on the other hand, has been more fortunate and has had better adaptations, such as the 1954 version, the 1968 Italian series with Irene Papas as Penelope, and the television version with Armand Assante and Isabella Rossellini.

In the film Silvana Mangano plays two roles, as Penelope, the faithful wife of Ulysses and the sorceress Circe. American star Kirk Douglas plays the Greek hero, Ulysses, while Anthony Quinn plays Antinous.

Unfortunately, the limits of time, budget, and technology prevented a full adaptation of The Odyssey, which is a spectacular story. Even so, it is a good adaptation, portraying Polyphemus, the Sirens, and the goddess Circe — whose character was combined with Calypso. The gods were completely omitted.

However, the performances by Kirk Douglas as Ulysses and Silvana Mangano as Penelope/Circe are excellent.

Ulysses' journey to the underworld was also changed: instead, Circe summons figures from the realm of the dead, such as Agamemnon, in an attempt to convince Ulysses to accept immortality and stay with her. This shows that the plots of Circe and Calypso were merged.

It’s also worth noting that Ulysses kills the men who sought to take his wife and his kingdom, staying faithful to the original work.",0,0,1752435825.0,Discussion,0.38,True,False,Soggy-Discipline5656,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lz1v01/ulysses_1954_the_great_major_adaptation_of_the/,new,low

The action scenes, even though well shot, felt meh because the music felt (imo) just mismatched. 

The classic music, needle drop action scenes I've loved include Kill Bill 1, Japanese restaurant fight, The Matrix - any fight, particularly the lobby scene, and Run Lola Run running sequences. 

It doesn't have to be action, for example, the docking scene from Interstellar hits hard because of the rousing score. 

So does Joker's action scenes during the party or jailbreak in The Dark Knight.

horror is my favorite genre, but Romance is a close second, so I was thinking about movies where the two genre coexist without the Romance taking over. Like, I didn't really like Warm Bodies because that's 97% romcom, the horror element for me was pretty absent.

movies,1lyzfu0,Movies that did not have any meaning or impact to you until you got older?,"For me it’s the movie Sideways. I think I was in 9th grade when it came out and all the adults around me from family to teachers were talking about how awesome it was. I watched it one night after my parents rented it and I was like “Man this is boring, no tits or explosions and the jokes aren’t funny”

But now I am 35 and divorced. I been through phases of depression and self doubt and crawled out of metaphorical dark pits to become happy and adjusted. I am coincidentally a teacher like the protagonist, and have done a lot of traveling with buddies and seen all my friends and family go through the adulting experience. I have my niche hobbies that I enjoy and seek out for simple pleasures in life. I’ve had deep conversations with myself about why I’m doing certain things, and pondering on the significance of big steps I have taken.

Because of all that, I think the movie is great. 

It’s just the type of movie you can’t really appreciate or truly get until you have some of those big life experiences under your belt. As a young person it’s hard to relate to, but as an adult it sometimes hits you in the stomach with how relatable it can be either through the four protagonist or just the fact sometimes tough experiences life throws at you. 

What are some movie for y’all that just didn’t click for you until you got older? 

Also as a bonus for me basically all the Coen brother’s movies. As a young person I couldn’t stay awake for them, now I find them side splittingly funny and very enjoyable.

Yet despite the poor reception online because many people nitpick about these films and compare them with the animated versions (even though a lot of the animated versions were inspired by or later adaptations of even much older fairy tales or children tales of past centuries), there are still a lot of these live-action remakes year after year so my assumption tells me that there must be an audience out there for these products.

But on the other side of the spectrum, there are numerous nitpicks online that try to dissect every aspect of these films which I am admittedly confused because I do not seem to recall the same reception on the animated films or even previous live-action films before the recent remakes became more prominent.

So I am assuming that this is because of the mass appeal or massive influence of social media because messages spread fast.

So, perhaps this is a factor as to why there are more and more criticisms again these remakes?

movies,1lyyi5s,An annoying trend I’ve seen online when people discuss directors,"“Ryan Coogler wasn’t a draw, _Sinners_ was successful because of the concept and/or Michael B. Jordan.”

“Film Twitter loves to rip on J. J. Abrams, but if Tony Scott had directed _Mission: Impossible III_ and it was the exact same movie otherwise, they’d love it!”

And so on and so forth. I especially see this in r/boxoffice and similar spots. Look, on one very narrow and superficial level, there’s a technically defensible claim here. Outside of a very small handful of A-list filmmakers including Cameron, Nolan, Spielberg, and Tarantino, very few people outside of hardcore cinephiles will see a movie simply because a particular director was attached. That much is true.

But the way some people discuss the topic, you’d think that directors are mostly totally interchangeable units, and that’s simply not the case. _Sinners_ wouldn’t have happened without Coogler because it was his original idea, of course, but the reason that an R-rated vampire movie earned so much at the box office was because it was obviously well-crafted. Audiences noticed this, and they responded accordingly. That’s not something that just any director could have delivered! _Mission: Impossible III_ or any other movie directed by someone else would’ve been fundamentally different, and that has to be accounted within any “what if?” scenario.

I think this point is relevant to the discourse surrounding some of the big blockbusters released thus far this summer. People talk about _Jurassic World_ like it’s some bulletproof franchise, and I would agree that it’s very hard to screw up, but you need some minimal level of technical competence to create an engaging dinosaur movie. I don’t think Gareth Edwards is the second coming of Spielberg or anything, and the critical consensus has hardly been kind toward the film, but most agree that the action sequences were suitably thrilling for the general audiences. You cannot take that for granted! Similarly, people have breathlessly insisted that James Gunn wasn’t a draw for _Superman_. But this discounts the fact that he turned in a _good_ movie, which surely made the difference at the domestic box office. Gunn’s track record beforehand suggested he’d deliver a good superhero movie, and he came through. You can argue that the international box office left something to be desired, but given the state of the DC brand, it’s easy to imagine a hypothetical scenario where a Superman reboot could’ve gone much worse.

movies,1lywxxw,Henry & June (1990),"Henry & June is a biographical film loosely based on the book of the same name by Anaïs Nin, published posthumously in 1986. 

In Paris, 1931, the French writer Anaïs Nin, while researching D.H. Lawrence, finds herself drawn to the many shades of human sexuality. Alongside her husband, Hugo Guiler, she befriends the American writer Henry Miller and his volatile, bisexual wife, June. Miller, a then-unknown New Yorker on the verge of publishing Tropic of Cancer, sees Anaïs as a sensual, almost childlike presence. He drifts into an affair with her, one that lacks real intensity, while June’s feelings seem to run far deeper.

Maria de Medeiros, as Nin, brings a luminous face and a gentle grace that nearly carry this beautiful, though ultimately elusive, sexual journey. Director Philip Kaufman seems to aim for the same uninhibited spirit as his characters, but despite the film’s NC-17 rating, the sex scenes feel restrained. Even when nudity appears, like in the brothel sequence—it fails to evoke any real eroticism.

Fred Ward plays Miller with a certain restraint, which isn’t helped by a bald cap that at times feels oddly unconvincing. Uma Thurman, in the smaller role of June, is given too much room to pose and play, but her performance is looser, and she injects the story with a much-needed sense of danger.

The film is rich in atmosphere, its pace is swift, and it leans into fantasy, but it falls short of being a bold exploration of sexuality. Perhaps because, in the end, Kaufman isn’t willing to take the same risks his characters do.

I keep imagining what it would be like if the film had a sequel and showed Anaïs Nin in an incestuous relationship with her father.

My brother had the traditional opinion. He absolutely hates Corporal Upham and says he's a coward and gets absolutely enraged by the fact he didn't help while Adam Goldberg got stabbed to death. 

I however, can't be mad at Corporal Upham. The movie showed time and time again that he was not a solider. He was a boy that was sent to war and he even tried to tell Captain Miller he wasn't cut out for the frontlines and Miller took him anyway instead of finding a different translator. He didn't just stand there and let his friend die because he didn't feel like helping. He was having a panic attack because everybody around him was getting blown to bits. I think 95% of Americans if they were put in the movie would be Corporal Upham and do the same thing. If there's anybody to be mad at, it's the US government for drafting and sending boys like Corporal Upham to war. You could also blame Captain Miller because he gave the order to set Steamboat Willie free after he killed Medic Wade. 

TL/DR: I think the hate for Corporal Upham is misguided by people who didn't understand that aspect of the film.

movies,1lywabt,In a nutshell: Hollywood's point of no return —  Jaws turns 50,"*“It’s as if God created the devil and gave him… jaws.”*

https://preview.redd.it/a2m5buymuncf1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=822b1926ea45971fe672c77a962c8952cf5fa25b

Recently, it was 50 years since the premiere of **Steven Spielberg's Jaws**.

A great movie about the struggle with the unknown. A thriller that can keep you on edge even after half a century. A simple story about completely different people who were able to find a common language in a critical situation.

In June 1975, Spielberg first showed the world his talent. How he knows how to glue the viewer to the screen. How naturalistically he shows the routine of his characters. How he works with children. How carefully he treats details. And, of course, how coolly he frames the frame.

Surprisingly, in the 21st century, Jaws has lost neither its charm, nor its dynamics, nor its horror, nor its stature. The opening scene with the painful death of a girl is still shocking. The severed head of a fisherman still frightens those who are watching the film for the first time. Hunter Quint's monologue about the cruiser Indianapolis is still touching.

[The film is based on the novel Jaws by Peter Benchley \(1974\)](https://reddit.com/link/1lywabt/video/hb0y4yc8yncf1/player)


The story of its creation gives the film a special flair — it became the first American film to be shot in the open ocean. The director still claims that refusing to shoot in a studio pool was the most naive and stupid decision in his life.

The shark was constantly breaking down. Sudden changes in the weather slowed down the already protracted filming. Yachts and boats kept appearing in the background — they had to wait until they disappeared from view. In addition, the entire film crew got seasick, and the main characters' ship almost sank at one point.

But it was worth it — ""Jaws"" changed the landscape of the film business forever. Steven shot the first blockbuster in history, essentially becoming the father of an entire film trend. Partly thanks to his work, all the major Hollywood franchises that we know today were born.

[The first film in the history of distribution that managed to conquer the coveted 100 million mark](https://reddit.com/link/1lywabt/video/8u9pibhyyncf1/player)


There was more to come. The shark saga turned out to be only the first cult series launched by Spielberg. In the 80s, he created **Indiana Jones**, in the 90s — **Jurassic Park**. The director has always had a keen sense of the demands of the general public and satisfied them with undisguised perfectionism.

It is important to give him credit — Steven did not entrench himself strictly in an entertaining, ""one-track"" genre. On the contrary, the director was always in search of experiments and complex themes. So, 18 years later, he released the monumental **Schindler's List**. A little later — **Saving Private Ryan**. Then **Minority Report**.

His career is that very Hollywood fairy tale that became reality. And it began 50 years ago. When he made one of the pearls of the ""New Hollywood"", on par with **The Godfather**, **Taxi Driver**, **The Exorcist**. When he, together with his outstanding colleagues, showed that cinema can be like this.

[The filming process stretched to 155 days instead of the originally planned 52 days](https://reddit.com/link/1lywabt/video/yu8drd8vwncf1/player)


*“I have good memories of working on Jaws, but I have way more bad memories. I still have nightmares about it and wake up in a cold sweat. But I’m grateful for that movie. Because it was like a baptism for me. Not only did I survive it, which was my main goal because it was hard to survive that without losing something, but I also got a career. Whatever I say about the nightmares, I’ll always be grateful for the fact that I got to fulfill my dream of being able to make any movie I wanted. That continues to this day.”*

movies,1lyvdb4,BACK TO THE FUTURE,"I've changed my mind on this, if I'm being honest. Part of me would do anything to see a new Back to the Future film—purely for the nostalgia boost. The DeLorean, the soundtrack, the vibe—it's classic. But then again, I just don't think that it needs it. The trilogy concluded perfectly well, and it still holds up today. It's lightning in a bottle.

Every time there's a reboot or ""legacy sequel,"" I ready myself. Ghostbusters: Afterlife was good, but it didn't resonate in the same. Blade Runner 2049 was breathtakingly gorgeous, yes, but it really floundered. And don't even start with me on Tron: Legacy—so much potential, and yet… ugh.

And moreover, recasting Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd? No way. You can't recreate that chemistry. Even the thought of recasting sends me a bit off. I'd rather just leave it alone, or perhaps perhaps—very possibly—do something entirely new in the same universe, something like a spin-off with fresh characters and an entirely different time-travel device.

movies,1lyul78,'Apocalypse Now' is one of the greatest - if not THE greatest - cinematic experiences I've ever had,"An ever-degrading fever dream. That's what watching Apocalypse Now I felt like. It probably didn't help that I watched it while coming down from a fever, sweating and a little uncomfortable, with an overcast, drizzling sky outside - but damn, the *atmosphere* this movie creates is second to none.

It's a bad trip that gets worse and worse, as Willard and his crew undertake their hellish odyssey down the river to find Kurtz. I've read Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and I was aware that Apocalypse Now is loosely based on that story. It's a masterful interpretation of that story, widening the scope and scale and making it feel somehow even more sinister.

A lot of this is due to how the movie *looks.* Apocalypse Now might be the most visually stunning movie I've ever watched. It's frankly insane to me that it came out almost *50* years ago because it would still blow away pretty much anything released by even the best directors today. It looks so bold, lush and vibrant, with incredible shot composition and lighting. A sickly orange-yellow glow suffuses the landscape, and mist and fog always shrouds the horizon. It's like the characters are traversing through hell, and it adds to the dreamlike feel of the movie.

It also has one of my favourite cinematic interpretations of war in a movie. Sure, it shows war as bad, and Americans as imperialists and all of that. But more than that, in Apocalypse Now, war is much more abstract, a dark, primordial force that acts as both catalyst and conduit for humanity's darkest urges. It affects everyone. Killgore, Kurtz, the boys on the boat, Willard. Everyone becomes a beast prowling through the jungle. 

Marlon Brando's limited screen time is as impressive as advertised - both the writing and his performance, along with how he's shot - portray him as almost a mythical figure out of a twisted fairy tale. Kurtz is more a concept and an idea than a man. Martin Sheen is more restrained, but you can always see the madness just under the surface.

And there's that steadily escalating nightmare-feel of the movie, and what makes it so damn incredible. Each sequence and set piece feels more surreal, bleak and unhinged than the last, culminating with the ritual slaughter/assassination at the temple that's one of the most jaw-dropping scenes I've seen in a long time. Honestly, even if you choose not to overanalyze the movie or interpret what it's trying to say, I think it would still be a 5-star watch based simply on the power of its audiovisual presentation alone. It's such a staggering achievement in filmmaking, I can't say enough about it.

I remember working and going to school all week and then tried to watch Monty Python’s Holy Grail and not finding it even a little funny as I struggled to stay awake.

I also found Boyhood tedious and ostentatious, but ten years after it came out, I’ve seen the injustices of men allowed to fail upwards as shitty fathers, and women needing to make moral bargains just to care for their children, but understand it’s not always a choice. Boyhood really captured that through Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette’s empathetic portrayals. 

Lastly, I liked Hereditary on first viewing. It was so well acted and sad af, but it didn’t scare me. (I’d just gone through a traumatic event, so that might have made me numb in that regard).

Maybe it's nostalgia for the type of characters from 90's, don't know. 

I love both movies now. In the past I actually saw Hackers as kinda mediocre movie. I watched Matrix more times than Hackers. They are very different.

Hackers is not the best movie for sure. But its atmosphere and characters did hit me in such a comfort way recent times no other movie ever did.

movies,1lym2jd,Once upon a time in Hollywood is a perfect ambiance film that I could never watch in 1 sitting,"This is the first film I've consciously viewed to expand my taste beyond the cookie cutter blockbusters and view films that might challenge me in one way or another/I would have ignored cause ""its not my cup of tea"".

**The only challenge here?** Who on gods green earth under the age of 45 can watch this thing in 1 sitting? It feels like a waste of a whole afternoon, If I had to watch this in one sitting , it would make me stressed and I'd be a lot more critical. If I had oodles of money and was set in life - this is the kinda expensive shit I'd be doing lmao.  But I've been watching this 40 minutes at a time in the evenings and it feels just right. All of a sudden, a scene doesn't necessarily have to ""go"" anywhere or prove anything, if I had to crank this movie out I'd be annoyed as shit. 

The only creative choice that really made me go hmm was this introduction of a narrator in the last 40-50 something minutes of the film. It just kinda came outta nowhere. While I understand they were jumping forward in time , had a lot of details to get through, etc. Was this an old trope that Tarantino was paying homage too? It kinda took me out of it tbh. 

The ending, I think Rick's arc was a touching one and the film handled it beautifully. I would argue the physical conflict involving the home break-in was a liiiittle forced but I understand its what the movie was trying to set up for in earlier scenes so I respect that it was cohesive for its own goals.  

But overall, 

**I am extremely glad this movie exists.**

It feels decadent, rich, and filled with great performances by everyone. The attention to detail transporting you a bygone era while the subtle character journey keeps you invested in the present scene. I'm not super old (in my twenties) but this really feels like a fine wine kinda film, I'm not going to rewatch it every year but every 5? I think it carries even more relevance for the older crowd as eras/ages of our own lives begin or come to a close.

movies,1lyl4bw,Spielberg’s directing is amazing even in his lesser movies,"Was recently rewatching The Lost World and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to see how they hold up. Both of these films are absolutely flawed, but I am happy to say I really enjoy them, especially Lost World. 

Still, both of these movies have some of the dumbest fucking scenes I’ve ever seen that I genuinely don’t know how they got out of the writers room. Kicking the raptor out the window, Nuking the fridge, swinging with Monkeys, the entire character of Mac in Crystal Skull, all of that was pretty bad. 

But man, there is some genuinely brilliant filmmaking in both, some of my favorite scenes from Spielberg ever. Everything with the T-Rex’s in Lost World is incredible. The Raptors long grass scene, all impeccably shot and tensely crafted filmmaking. Lost World is far and away the best Jurassic Park sequel. I really enjoy the San Diego 3rd act but it does absolutely feel very disconnected from the rest of the film. 

I love Crystal Skull’s opening at Area 51, vintage Indiana Jones, as well as the chase at the University. Love the chemistry between Shia Laboeuf and Harrison Ford, as they have a very interesting dynamic. I honestly think this movie is mostly very enjoyable, but definitely has the weakest 3rd act in the series. Everything after the Ants fight and waterfall is pretty stale. Still, the direction just has so much energy and urgency when compared to Dial of Destiny, which I think is good but slightly worse than Crystal Skull. Just nothing can beat Spielberg’s directing.

movies,1lyk2xp,"A Concentration Camp, a Father, and the Armor of Imagination","Rewatched Life is Beautiful today. When I was around 17, I asked my uncle, a Marine what he watches when he feels down or lost. He didn’t even pause didn’t even have to think. He said Life is Beautiful. At the time, I watched it but I don’t think I fully grasped it. My mind was still too young, maybe too untouched by life to comprehend it’s quiet ache, too cushioned to understand the quiet devastation hidden behind the laughter. I thought it was sweet, sad but now after life has carved itself into me now I really see it. 

Now at 29, rewatching it hit differently. I felt it in my bones. This film isn’t just a piece of cinema. This isn’t just a movie. It’s a father’s quiet rebellion against despair. A love story in the middle of a war. A reminder that sometimes the most heroic thing you can do is protect someone’s sense of wonder even as the world around you falls apart. It’s a meditation on love in it’s purest form. On fatherhood. On the power of imagination as a shield against horror. On hope when everything around you screams despair. It’s a love letter to the human spirit. To a father’s refusal to let the world dim his child’s light.
It doesn’t ask you to deny pain it simply shows you how light can still exist within it.

Watching Guido that beautiful, foolish, radiant man laugh, joke, shield his son with nothing but imagination, it broke me. It reminded me of my uncle. How he never spoke much about what he saw or lived through, but how he showed up always with strength, always with humor. Maybe this is what he was trying to teach me all those years ago. That life will not always be fair. It will hurt. It will take but it will also give. And in the middle of all of it, you still get to choose how you love. You still get to choose how you show up for the people you love. You still get to choose beauty.

Now coming to the movie Guido’s character is joy incarnate. He walks into every room with a joke, a sparkle, a story. Even when he’s thrown into unimaginable darkness, he keeps that light burning not for himself but for his son. Watching Guido smile through horror make a game out of hell protect his son’s innocence with nothing but humor and heart, it destroyed me. Not because it was sad. But because it was so full of love. That rare, boundless, unconditional kind. Sometimes surviving isn’t enough. Sometimes you have to find a way to make life feel beautiful even when it’s not. 

And I finally understood why my uncle a man who had tasted darkness and still chose kindness turned to this movie. Because some people don’t survive just for themselves. They survive for the ones they love. They laugh not because they’re blind to pain but because they know sometimes laughter is the only armor we’ve got. That kind of strength the quiet, selfless kind he carried too. Maybe that’s why he loved this film so much. Maybe that’s why he wanted me to see it.

I wish I could sit with him today and tell him I finally get it. Years later, I finally get it. That I understand now what he was trying to show me back then. And I carry that with me now, a deeper understanding of what it means to love through pain, to protect with laughter and to believe in beauty when the world gives you every reason not to. That Life is Beautiful isn’t about denying suffering, it’s about choosing love anyway. Even when it’s hard. Even when it hurts.

So tonight, I sat with the version of me who was 17 and the version of me now. And we both cried. For the things we’ve seen. For the innocence we lost. And for the reminder that even in the most broken places, light still finds a way in.

So if your heart is heavy, if you feel like you’re losing grip watch this movie. Life is Beautiful. Not always. Not easily. But sometimes because someone chooses to make it so.

Today is Brunei.

Our fourth day winner, from Bhutan, is **Lunana: A Yak in the Classroom (2019) directed by Pawo Choyning Dorji.** It is a family drama that was nominated for the best international film at the 2022 Academy Awards. You can currently find it on Amazon Prime Video with subtitles. 

Okay let's do **Brunei.**

It's one of the smallest countries in Asia located in the southeast Asian islands near Malaysia. There might not be a lot of film from here, but let's shine the light on this unique Asian Muslim monarchy. 

The rules:

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

Regardless, the pain of losing a friend whom I thought of as a sister still hurts deeply after all this time and distance, and I know there isn't really much I can do about it.

Here’s what I recall:

	•	In the dream or alternate world, the mother is walking through a surreal, junkyard-like space – not a real dump, but more of a utopian limbo filled with strange, random objects and colorful (especially pinkish), soft visuals.
	•	She sees a girl there and starts talking to her, slowly realizing that it’s the daughter she never gave birth to.
	•	The daughter says something like “I can’t come back with you — you didn’t let me be born.”
	•	The whole film had a very emotional, dreamy, eerie atmosphere.

movies,1lyay3k,OldBoy (2003),"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!

This is a bit of a long one

Just got finished watching this movie as i have heard people talk about it a lot especially with high praise from critics and average viewers alike.

 I very much liked the soundtrack the opening scene music was just awesome (the word i really mean is floating out of reach in my head), the action is impeccable especially that halfway scene and the teeth torture both the first time and almost the second time performances from both choi min sik (oh dae su) and his antithesis nemesis Yo Ji-tae (lee woo jin) the main concept i found extremely unique especially the secret imprisonment however as the mistery unfolded and got closer to the truth i found myself both increasingly bored,bitter,frustrated and uninterested with the potential answer by the time we got to the end and all was revealed i just didnt care and wanted the movie to end the revenge that his sister and lee wo jin were in love and oh dae su took this from him and in response he pretty much did the most horrific thing to you could think the psychological pain that must come with having sex with someone your in love with and is such a light in your life then to find out its your own daughter is sickening and so painful i luckily cannot imagine. Lee wo jin is a truly monstrous individual and i find his suicide at the end not satisfying or i dont enjoy but i find it perfect in the movie.

Thats it for me i havent touched on everything but i hope you understand what it is i think and I appreciate the thoughts this film has given me as much as i wasnt that enamoured with some parts

movies,1ly8639,Movies that you *want* to like or should like but somehow don’t resonate with you. (Not movies that have let you down or disappointed you),"Let me iterate again that these are not movies that you were looking forward to but let you down, those discussions have been done before.

Sometimes there are movies that check all your boxes but yet in the end just don’t end up resonating with you. These aren’t necessarily bad movies, they can be very well made or critically acclaimed. You might’ve been in the wrong mood, lack the right context, or just an aspect of it kept it short of a movie you’d go back to. Or just plainly inexplicable as to a reason why. 

My current big one is GMK: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack! It’s regarded as one of the best Godzilla films of the Millennium era. It’s done by the same guy who directed the Gamera Trilogy which I adore. Yet I can’t seem to really resonate with the movie. I’m not sure if it’s the tone, Godzilla’s design or the different direction they took this reincarnation’s origin, etc. It’s hard for me to come up with a definitive reason why I can’t get into it and it bothers me to the point where I’ve watched it 3 times to see if there was something I missed or if it was a mood issue. 

Crimson Peak is another, my god this movie is brimming with atmosphere and visual delight, the performances were great and the whole idea of a gothic romance movie is something we need more of. But I don’t find myself coming back to the movie. Maybe it was the expectation of it being a horror movie, but even then watching it again as a gothic romance it just doesn’t fully click with me. Maybe it’s the fact that it pays homage to the Hammer Horror films and I don’t have much experience with that series.

La La Land. Ugh I love musicals so much, and I had a blast watching this for the first time. But whenever I get the musical mood I end up skipping on La La Land and going directly to the movies that inspired it. It’s not that it’s bad in my eyes, maybe it’s the fact that the older musicals/dance movies were better. And that my initial enjoyment of watching it for the first time was to see something in the same vein finally after a lack of good movie musicals. 

How about you guys? I’d love to see if people have had similar experiences, or to help give context of something we missed in a movie to help better appreciate it.

movies,1ly7q8k,My personal theory regarding The Prestige (2006) by Christopher Nolan,"One of the Borden twins killed their wife Sarah.

Yes, that's what I think. It was not a suicide, she was murdered. Here's why I think so:

1. We are never explicitly shown Sarah hanging herself in the prop room. We only see her entering the room and then boom her body is hanging down in the middle of the room.
2. The Borden twin had the motive to kill her. We saw a heated scene where Sarah was so distraught and angry at Borden and she said “I know what you really are.” This must have led Borden to suspect that Sarah knows about their truth (or atleast suspects it) and he would obviously never want that to come out at any cost.
3. At a restaurant, Olivia told Borden that Sarah wanted to meet her and tell her the truth about Borden to her. If Sarah had plans to kill herself why would she arrange for a meeting with Olivia?
4. The scene where Borden (the twin that must have killed Sarah) is meeting with Fallon (the twin which must have been in love with Sarah) in the jail, he says to him, ""I'm sorry about Sarah"". It could have been a subtle confession from him.
5. The killer Borden twin was subjected to death by hanging in the end which is exactly what he subjected Sarah to.
6. The murder took place in the prop room, the room which is filled with Borden's secrets. Sarah's death is just another of Borden's secrets in that room.",0,11,1752345570.0,Discussion,0.19,True,False,AugustusCaesar00,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ly7q8k/my_personal_theory_regarding_the_prestige_2006_by/,new,low

It's quite remarkable how this movie is going this way till interval, and then going back post interval and packs so much story in between its never ending action. 

Hardy & Theron nail their part but Nicholas Hoult character win the movie for me. 

Before this movie, I never expected a movie to be all action. You expect movies to set a plot, to set up characters, to set up story, MMFR does everything without slowing down, and that's art for me.

It's like a video game where you follow the main character. It's like a heavy metal song you love. It's like the best TV series payoff you wait to happen for years. It's legit perfect.

Well, I watched it. And now I’m wondering if I accidentally sat through a two-hour emotional scam with dramatic music.

Let’s be real — the plot is *painfully predictable*. Four addicts spiral into misery. That’s it. No twists, no nuance, no real exploration of *why* or *who* they are. It’s like the script was written on a napkin:

""Step 1: Introduce people. Step 2: Ruin them slowly. Step 3: Make sure everyone is traumatized. Roll credits.""

The characters aren’t built — they’re *dropped in*. We’re not given the space to care about them as people. They're basically blank templates wearing pain like a costume. I don’t even think the movie wants us to connect with them — just to *watch* them fall apart like a montage of misery.

And the soundtrack? Yes, it’s beautiful. But it's **abused** to death. You could be brushing your teeth in that movie and the violins would be going full apocalypse. It’s like the director had one emotional tool and just *slammed it into every scene* to beg for gravitas.

The editing? Look, quick cuts and visual tricks don’t make up for a lack of storytelling. Half the movie felt like someone discovering Premiere Pro for the first time and deciding *“faster = deeper.”*

People say this movie hits so hard you’ll never rewatch it. Honestly? I *could* rewatch it with my grandma and we’d both just be like, “Okay… and?” Nothing in this film shocked me — because everything was broadcast from the beginning. It’s not bold, it’s just *loud*.

movies,1ly1lod,Watching Logan (2017)— has there ever been any other trilogy that started off awful and ended on such a high note?,"X-Men: Origins had a different director than James Mangold granted, but hotdog water level writing and questionable FX made it borderline unwatchable. Then Mangold takes the reigns in The Wolverine, which while an improvement also suffers from a generic to downright bad third act that feels slapdash and rushed compared to the rest of the film (the director’s cut helps this somewhat). Then we get Logan, which IMO, is the best genre film aside from The Dark Knight (and Nolan’s trilogy had its own stumble with the enjoyable but flawed Rises). 

Is there any other trilogy that was so miles ahead of the first film? Or is Logan the only exception to this rule? 

Edit: I should preface, as rightly pointed out (thank you folks) that the trilogy could be defined loosely in this sense — but these were the three stand alone outings as Jackman’s Wolverine so, to that end, that was my metric for defining them as such and also because they do acknowledge events from the film. I believe they even tried to get Lieve back as Sabretooth and modeled X-24 after his look from Origins. So to that end, I don’t discount it.

movies,1ly12t6,"Before Sunset might be the most perfect sequel ever, and just an incredible movie overall","I decided to jump into Richard Linklater's well-regarded Before trilogy as I recently finished the Normal People series and have been in the mood for melancholy romantic stories. Before Sunrise was really, really good - charming, romantic and captured that exuberance of doe-eyed youthful passion so well.

But Before Sunset, man, it's just on another level. Maybe it's because I'm the same age as the characters now, in my 30s and married and with some life experience but it felt so resonant. Jesse and Celine have grown and changed over the past decade - they're more jaded and cynical, and not the hopeless romantics they used to be. But this growth is what lends so much more depth and complexity in both personalities and the current state of their relationship, and how much that one night steered the course of their lives in the ensuing years.

As with Sunrise, the dialogue is really the star here and it's even better than before. Whereas in Sunrise, Jesse and Celine's conversations leaned more towards more fun and youthful and often idealistic, sometimes pseudo-intellectual (makes sense given their age), here they're tinged with a melancholy and occasional bitterness that can only be brought on by experiencing more of life. In Vienna, Jesse and Celine talked about art and love and literature and all these grand, human-condition concepts. Here, they talk about global warming, crime and broken romances. It's actually crazy just how well the script captures just how I've myself been feeling in my 30s.

Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's chemistry is as amazing as ever, and really sell the whole concept and premise.

movies,1lxvglr,"[SPOILER]  Presence: ok, bear with me","Last chance: heavy spoilers ahead!

Ok, I'm seeing everybody gushing about Tyler ""redeeming himself"" by saving his sister as a ghost... but did he have any chance to choose?

Tyler saves Chloe while alive, because his own ghost wakes him up. right? 

He couldn't wake up on his own, so he had to be dead to do so... but he wouldn't have died if he hadn't woken up. 

Yes it's a time loop and the movie tells you so, but it's a loop that effectively strips Tyler of  his own free will: both alive and dead, it's his counterpart to act in a meaningful way. It's like he's condemned to be retconned.

The ""time loop"" concept is also weird because we see the whole plot happening once and then Tyler ascends to the heavens or whatnot, but the fact that his ghost decides to retro-act to save his sister would suggest that he knows what happens if he doesnt? So there's potentially a whole slew of timelines where Chloe gets killed, but it's ignored because we're focusing on this plot. Ok?

All in all, I would have preferred if the ghost was Nadia's. It would have fit nicely with the serial killer theme and give the victims agency. Tyler being the hero felt forced to me, not to mention it will forever reinforce the golden child picture his mother already had in mind. Plus, her spelling out ""IT WAS HIM HE CAME BACK TO SAVE YOU"" takes away interpretations from the audience. Hadn't it been for that moment I could have chosen to believe it was Nadia anyway and would have loved the movie more.

Cherry on top: Oh. My. God. This family was already in bad waters before, now it's about to get royally fucked: already Mom was dismissive of Chloe and had only eyes for Tyler. Now Tyler died to save Chloe from the guy she was having sex with... how long would it takes for her to blame Chloe for ""not keeping it in her pants"" or something like that? Chloe was already sad and mistreated by Tyler, who now became a hero, but they never talked or reconciled and another grief adds up the three she already bore. And Dad... poor dad. I hope he gets Chloe and runs. Yesterday.

movies,1lxrl3u,"Sovereign, the subject, the marketing, the review. SPOILER FREE","I'll start by saying political discourse is not the point of this post. 
I won't be responding to this post.

I just needed to get my thoughts out and I hope you enjoy reading them. I'm splitting this into 3 parts, it's long so read or don't.  Hope you do.

This is my take of Sovereign. 


The Marketing.

2 weeks ago I saw a trailer for this that didn't give anything away, about a movie centered around the idea of sovereign citizenship. Starring Nick Offerman and had Robert Redford. The trailer said it won awards at a festival, that's it for promotion.

There was no by the creator of, directed by, from the studio that brought you. It showed vague clips with the actors and that was it. 

Then it said available to buy or stream in 2 weeks.

The absolute mammoth balls, the type of balls that drag and rip up concrete as you walk ahead. The confidence. 

Here is our movie, here's a taste, and it is incredibly easy to watch oh let's say 2 weeks from now.

In a world where movies are advertised years in advance, with press tours, taco bell sponsorships, tweets about politics, Jimmy Fallon playing 'what would a sovereign citizen do'

They, and I mean they because I still dont know who produced or wrote or directed or anything about this movie, they collectively said hey world. We are releasing this movie in 2 weeks. Also its gonna be incredibly easy to watch.

The Subject.

This movie treats the subject with an insane level of respect and with that I respect the hell out of this movie.

I am of the opinion that a sovereign citizen is a batshit idea that I laugh at watching cops. I'm not here to defend either side, just where I stand. 

This movie doesn't walk on eggshells. It doesn't take cops Films and throw them for amusement.

It respects the subject. It respects the idea of a sovereign citizen. It portrays a citizen. It never makes fun or takes the low road. The movie seems to be made by, a sovereign citizen.

And that interests the FUCK out of me.

The Movie.

The movie from my interpretation...

Once again this is mine and mine alone for you to read and agree or disagree with, this is a very real examination of real humans and the way they think and live and this is my interpretation of it.

The movie is an examination of the law from the sovereign citizen side and the ones that enforce the laws side.

It follows two sets of father son teams with extremely different perceptions and interpretations of the 'law' who are both equally trying to raise their son, both hoping to instill what they believe, but both also allowing for free will.

Very very special. Everything about this movie seems special.

Oscar's?
Writing? Could see it.
Best Actor? Could see it.
Best Supporting Actor? Could see it.
Directing? Could see it.
Movie of the year?  Could see it being nominated.

movies,1lxojca,Jurassic Park/World Franchise Short Term Solution,"After watching Jurassic World Rebirth, I am left wondering where the franchise should go from here. Realistically, it will continue on its current path until the movies are no longer profitable, go extinct for a few years until the inevitable reboot. 

Let’s assume the movies will continue (whether or not they should), where can they go from Rebirth? Nowhere interesting. I posit they should go backwards (for at least one movie). The next film should take place in the most interesting era of the franchise, directly following the original film. Isla Nublar is the most interesting setting in the Jurassic franchise, as evidenced by Jurassic Park and Jurassic World and the beginning of Fallen Kingdom. We don’t need more secret research islands or stations, we have the original park. Is this nostalgia bait? Of course it is, I’m working with what I’ve got here. 

Set the film immediately following the original and follow a rescue team onto the island. How does anyone know Nedry isn’t alive at the end of the original film? Were other staff unaccounted for when the island lost power? It would be really cool to see a team of pros walk past the destroyed jeeps and search the island showing us 
familiar locations from new angles. I would make this a horror film similar to Alien. No need to bring in legacy cast members as they are not age (or plot) appropriate. 

Make it a small cast getting picked off by dinos one by one like Alien or Predator. No hybrids or locusts or globetrotting adventures, just a moderate budget dinosaur horror movie. No A-list cast needed. Throw in Timothy Olyphant as the team lead/hero and you’ve got a stew going. This does not solve the long term problem of the brand, but it does reset the current trajectory and opens the door to smaller stories.

movies,1lxkm8n,I love Star Wars.,"Star Wars has always been a few of my favorite films. Not becasue they are necessarily great, or ground breaking all the time. But becasue I enjoy following a long story that I can piece together with my own initiative. For example I enjoy Episodes 1-6, regardless of the quality, it makes a nice rounded, and complete story from start to finish. And I also enjoy adding on many things from legends to them purely for the enjoyment of it. 

I find the visuals, even in the prequels to be really cool, to put it simply. The special effects and camera work always really struck me for the intensity. For example the famous Trench Run is awesome! You can feel the tension as Luke nears his target, him being one of the final survivors for the battle they had been loosing thus far. I often find this scene to be misinterpreted as being a fight that was too easy. And yet there are only 5 survivors out of I think 35-40? 

But anyway, whats your favorite moment from one of these films? I think personally mine would be the final Duel of Luke and Vader. =)",0,28,1752273644.0,Discussion,0.46,True,False,MrKrumpz793,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lxkm8n/i_love_star_wars/,new,low

Despite that dynamic, the supervisor feels the need to/has an unconscious habit of alternating like both his subordinate's friend and his superior.

movies,1lxgpc7,What do you consider the best entry level giant monster/kaiju movies,"For me, it's the following:

**Gamera the Brave:** It is definitely targeted to kids, but still has the brutal fights and the man-eating terrors you expect out of good monster action, and let's the human side shine as the priority. To me, it's a perfect movie, unless you let the absence of Gamera's iconic roar get to you (which is understandable), and have come to the conclusion it's the best medium representation of what giant monsters movies are capable of.

**Gamera 90s trilogy:**  It has all the things Gamera The Brave has, but definelty goes into the more darker view of what the monsters are capable of.

**Mothra vs Godzilla:** This is probably the most quintessional Godzilla movie. Not only is it the first time Toho started crossing over, but it's that nice mixture of whimsical entertainment that is meant to appeal to children, but still let's itself have a serious and endearing story. This is true for most of the Showa era of Godzilla and Toho films.

**Kong Skull Island:** For some reason, this is the perfect Monsterverse film overall. I like all the films so far, but this one felt closest in getting the film right for a kaiju film: horrorfying giant terrors mixed with enduring chracters we can root for (even if one of them is a building sized ape)

movies,1lxg6so,"What movies or tv shows from the last decade have given you goosebumps, chills or a sense of awe that left you feeling inspired in some way?","First, some guidelines for your suggestions and a bit of commentary on the state of film from 2014-2025 (because the year is only halfway over):

I picked 2014 forward because we've been inundated by film/video for a while now and it's simply become impossible to keep up (though I try). But I just don't want to miss a great story.

It could be just me, but it seems like in the past, every few years, a movie would drop that would strike an emotional chord deep within me. The film didn't necessarily need to have a twist ending to be deeply affecting -- it could've just made a profound statement about the human condition. In no particular order, some examples of movies that rewired my brain: Goodwill Hunting, Shawshank, The Matrix, Fight Club, Se7en, The Dark Knight, Inception, Memento, Pulp Fiction, Slumdog Millionaire, Cast Away, Trainspotting, Pixar's Up, Wall-E, Amalie, Exit Through The Gift Shop, The Professional, Nightcrawler, Ad Astra, Ex Machina, Whiplash, Breaking Bad (entire series), Season 1 of Westworld, HBO's Succession, Devs, Andor Seasons 1 & 2, and many more that I'm currently not remembering.

NOW, it goes without saying that taste is subjective. The above list are films/television that reached in my brain and tickled my neurons in a way I (hope) I'll never foreget. *This is different from merely stories I liked or really, really enjoyed watching.* For an example of some of those: The Bourne Identity, The Town, Tropic Thunder, The Incredibles, The Back to the Future Trilogy, Django Unchained, Inglorious Basterds, Everything Everywhere All At Once, Parasite, basically every Marvel movie with Iron Man and/or Spiderman in it, Top Gun Maverick, Mad Max Fury Road, and so on.

Ending with Fury Road drives home my point; it's a masterpiece, effortlessly rewatchable, gorgeous, delightfully bizarre, impeccably choreographed action. I love it. But it didn't seep into my thoughts the way that, say, The Shawshank Redemption has. I'll often compare situations I face in life to things that are ""Shawshank like"" and use that story as inspiration to endure. Perhaps Fury Road is every bit as well directed and told as 'Shawshank and they will always have seperate appeal. I don't ""carrry with me"" Fury Road. As much as I love Fury Road, it doesn't make it to my ""mind altering cinema"" list. Or take something like the TV show ""Succession"". It's not as deeply emotionally affecting as 'Shawshank, but I felt like it made sharp, insightful and true commentary on the American cultural zeitgeist and that's valuable in a way that transcends mere entertainment. Andor is similar in that it could actually function as a how-to guide on how to organize a rebellion should things descend even deeper into fascism. Stories like these help clarify and organize one's thoughts about culture; in this way they are profound. Pulp Fiction has a style to it that I remember to embody when life is taking a turn for the truly weird. I haven't found myself in a gimp suit locked away in a basement, but I've had a few nights like the one Vincent went through when Mia overdosed. In those high-stress situations, I remembered to have a sense of humor about it because of Pulp Ficiton showed me the way. Fight Club is constantly on my mind, reminding me to not allow the lust after material possessions supplant the things that truly matter.

So to restate and simpify, it could be that the stories I care most about either speak deep emotional truths or say something profound about modern culture, while being so expertly crafted as to be engaging and entertaining. It's what I define as ""quality"". If you agree or disagree, that's not the discussion I wish to have. I want to hear from you about what films were impressive to you and affected you deeply enough that they went beyond just being fun or pretty damn good.

We're Courtney Stephens and Callie Hernandez, the filmmakers of the recent meta-fictional feature INVENTION which riffs on real circumstances to explore the relationship between fantasy and grief -- both in personal life and how it reflects externally in America today. The film deals with weird medicine, losing dads and the emotional logic of conspiracy theory against the bucolic, literary backdrop of the Berkshires in the fall.

Synopsis: In the aftermath of a conspiracy-minded father’s unexpected death, his daughter receives his patent for an experimental healing device. Featuring archive from actress Callie Hernandez's actual late father, INVENTION explores the process of grieving a complicated parent, and the filmmaking itself becomes a part of the process.

David Lynch even said it himself in an interview about ""Inland Empire"" that he refuses to tell the meaning, because he believes that films should stand on its own.

movies,1lx1o2f,I have a theory about The Platform that recontextualizes the ending.,"I don’t think the girl was the message. I think *both Goreng and Baharat bled out and died* — and the panna cotta made it to the top alone.

There's one subtle scene that really supports this: when the head chef finds a hair in a returned panna cotta and loses his mind, searching for the culprit. It’s such an intense overreaction — unless you realize what it’s actually saying.

The panna cotta *was* meant to be a message of solidarity. A sign that even in a brutal system, someone chose not to consume. But because it returned without a ""messenger"", the people at the top misunderstood it.  
They didn't see a moral gesture.  
They saw a **defect**.

That’s the point: **a message without a messenger gets misread.**  
Even a perfect act of humanity becomes meaningless when the system above can’t comprehend it.

It’s a tragic commentary on communication, power, and how systems often **reject or distort hope** if it doesn't come in their language.

I watched The Substance recently and noticed that in the ending scene, just before monstro-Elisasue comes onstage, Harvey (Elisabeth and Sue's boss) says to the person next to him, (paraphrasing) ""She's my best creation, I shaped her to be a star."" And I'm wondering if this implies that he was involved in getting Elisabeth the substance in some way (knowing that she was the perfect star but was getting 'too old' and wanted someone exactly like her but younger)? The film was so filled with symbolism that I would be surprised if the director didn't intend it to mean anything, especially since a lot of details (like the person on the phone and the car that hits Elisabeth) aren't explicitly shown, presumably so they don't detract from the main plotline, but there's lots of areas there where Harvey might be involved.

movies,1lwz2s7,Sunshine (2007) is fucking amazing.,"This movie is just plain fun. Cillian Murphy kills it as kappa, our main protagonist. So many cool ideas for a film in this genre like the viewing room where we see a man get cooked alive by the sun. The space craft they're in has one of the coolest designs I've ever seen in a space/scifi film. Personally, I fully believe that the film stuck the landing as well. However the shaky cam at the end is nauseating and there's a certain bit towards the end that I rolled my eyes at. But other than that I really don't have very many other complaints this shit rocks. 

If you haven't seen Sunshine and you're a fan of scifi I highly highly recommend it. This is one of the greatest films to get high to as well if you partake.

movies,1lwyqrj,Reactions you saw to a film that happened based on where you saw the film.,"Sure, a film can play in thousands of theaters, but sometimes reactions may be different due to location, culture, etc.

One example is a scene in The Lion King (1994).

Word was the filmmakers learned that given the culture, it was taken as more serious than funny.

Anyways, onto why I posted this.

I wondered if anyone experienced an audience reaction to a film that happened based on where you saw it, the era you saw it, etc.

My example is seeing Independence Day in 1996, in San Diego, Ca.

So this thought came to me that if they can't make a good movie themselves can't individual or independent creators use the same source material give it under the tag parody and end up making something which is much more based. 

Or if possible can we make movies by independent creators how would be able to post it online without getting the regular permissions and getting a tied up in the legal drama instead focus on making the best movie possible so that this enough competition as due to legal issues in the lack of competition people have been providing us with substandard content and asking as to swallow it. 

For competition sake it should be that multiple people can create movies based on the same topic without having any impact and only the best version decided by the audience is the one which is allowed to exist.

As Richard's obsession grows, he learns from a friend that time travel may actually be possible through hypnosis. Richard travels in time to meet Elise, and the two appear destined to be together. However, Elise's jealous manager (Christopher Plummer) attempts to keep them apart. I really liked how it’s a different kind of time travel film where Christopher Reeve’s character doesn’t use a machine but uses hypnosis to go back to 1912 which I thought was great. It’s a very beautifully well done nicely shot film. The chemistry between Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour characters are fantastic.

I had no idea that one, much less both of the movies were going to go in fascinating directions with time (literally lol) like they did. 

Arrival is, of course, much more theoretical. I suppose it dabbled more in memory, than time, per se. The idea of being able to perceive language as a non-linear medium is absolutely fascinating to me. 

And Memento. Wow. That’s probably my favorite Nolan movie I’ve seen up to this point. I figured out pretty early on that the black-and-white colored scenes were moving forward linearly, and the fully colored scenes, backward. So, I guessed they would intersect at some point. But, I could never have guessed they would have met in the way they did. 

The way the two different timelines were inter-spliced was absolutely brilliant on a first viewing. But that being said, I don’t think it lends itself to an even better second viewing in the way other Nolan films do.

""Miami Vice"" follows two undercover detectives back on the mean streets of Miami, Florida, re-united after 40 years.

So the roles would be for older actors. I’m betting they’ll be A-listers since Kosinski tends to always work with those guys (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt etc).

Personally I think Pitt would be great for Crockett. And for Tubbs I think Mahershela Ali (or Denzel, but he’s already been an undercover cop in Training Day).

movies,1lwtfxz,What's that one movie(s) you watched as a young or preteen on TV in the early hours of the morning that was VERY clearly too gory or mature for your little virgin eyes?,"I have a few, must have been between the age of 10-13 and I had an old analogue TV in my room; this must have been back in 2008-2010. I remember watching predator, but it was more epic and cool to a young boy than gory. I think I watched predator 2 too, which I distinctly remember being quite mature. 

As horror movies go; I remember watching 'thirteen ghosts'. No idea what was happening and I remember hiding under my sheets most of the time but I didn't want to stop. 

My mum used to watch the saw movies on TV and while I never actively watched them, I would just casually pay vague attention in the corner of my eye while I was on my DS or something. 

Donnie darko was a BIG one that stuck with me. I had no idea what was happening (and to this day I haven't seen it properly as an adult). I just remember forcefields, someone saying they like someone's boobs, pills, a knife, a cinema, weird water orbs coming out of people's chest, and getting jumpscared by a rabbit costume that was more creepy than scary. I was captivated though and couldn't take my eyes off it, even if I don't remember much. 

Another one I had NO idea what was happening (a common theme) but there was a guy on a sail boat watching a girl rub an ice cube on her body. I was too young to understand the sexualisation of it but it was definitely just before the puberty hormones hit. To this day it sticks in my mind but I have no idea what movie it was. 

The cube 1997, that was disturbing but I didn't watch much. Saw 2 too, I remember the needles scene. 

Dreamcatcher; this is an interesting one. I was on the computer in my parents bedroom and it was the weekend so my dad had gone fishing. Mum was lying on the bed with my brother who must have been 5 or 6 at the time, and put the TV on for an appropriate pre-watershed (9pm) movie. I thought ""cool, I can play games as long as I want!"". It got to like 1am and various movies came and went, and I turned around to face the TV and dreamcatcher was on, so I watched it. All I remember is aliens and worm things that crawl up your bum from the toilet (I didn't want to sit on the toilet for a week). Mum woke up, saw what was on the TV, and blamed me thinking I put it on and was up way past my bed time. I didn't even touch the remote. I used to confuse this movie with ""slither"" until I figured out the differences.

""The thing"", the original 1982. That was wild, but I don't have anything to say. I think it was SO disturbing that my undeveloped brain couldn't identify what was so disturbing about it. It was just a mix of abstract non-gory flesh for me. It's interesting how me as a kid wasn't afraid or disgusted by it, but myself as an adult is. I honestly cannot watch that movie because of the body horror. 

Final fantasy: spirits within. I still need to watch this as an adult, I just remember it being sci fi on an alien planet with big dragon alien things or alien ghosts. I have no idea. Was I scared? I think so. I don't even know if it was a horror movie but It felt like it. 

Final destination, I don't remember much. Something about a fence wire cutting someone up, a man with a hook in a shadow, someone getting decapitated with an elevator, and a BBQ exploding. 

Van helsing and hell boy; but they are both fairly comical by today's standards so I remember enjoying them and they weren't disturbing at all. It was a ""hell yeah"" vibe. 

Chucky was weird. But that's it. All I remember is it being weird. It never scared me. 

The blade movies. Gory, but in a fun way. I'll also add the ""underworld"" movies in this category since it's vampires Vs werewolves. Don't remember anything about them though. 

Flight plan. All I remember is a little girl missing and it being more of a drama/thriller, but I think I got bored and turned it off. I've been meaning to watch it though as an adult.

The island. I remember quite a bit from this because I think I saw it a few times. Ewan McGregor was familiar because I'd seen him play obi wan in the star wars prequels, so that's probably why I paid attention because it ""had obi wan in it"". I know it's about clones, organ harvesting, the island >!doesn't exist!< , Michael Clarke Duncan crawling on the floor covered in blood being dragged away or something, they escape to the real world; I don't remember much else. I remember it being good though. 

Pan's Labyrinth. This was a SUPER weird one to be watching at 1am as a kid, but at least I could read subtitles because it's in Spanish. It's what started my adoration for practical effects in movies and specifically Guillermo del Toro. It was familiar because of hell boy, that I liked. 

Hollow man, 2000. This was definitely a weird one but I don't remember much, just the mirror scene and him being a pervert. 

30 days of night. All I remember is vampires and blood. 

AVP1, AVP2, and all the Alien movies. I remember watching them as a kid because my dad had the alien box set, the one with the green plastic. I watched all of them. Had no idea what was happening but it was satisfyingly scary. I was expecting my dad to say no because it might be too mature, but he just asked if I was sure if I wanted to watch them and I said yes. In retrospect as an adult, I understand why he wasn't that bothered because they're quite tame by today's standards.

Dog soldiers. Werewolves. Blood. Simple. I think that was one my mum put on again and I just watched in the corner of my eye in the living room on my DS. 

I think this phase stopped around 2009/2010, but it's something I just randomly became nostalgic for. That feeling as a kid watching and discovering something you feel you're not supposed to, just the thrill of watching something scary or disturbing at 1am on the TV. It's a feeling I'll never have again and if I didn't make this post, I'm afraid I might forget those formative memories and the nostalgia. 

Sorry it's a long post, if you made it this far thank you for reading.

movies,1lwosxy,My first time watching ERASERHEAD (1977),"**\*Sorry for the bad English\*** This was my first time watching David Lynch’s industrial surrealist film *Eraserhead*, and Here is my little review showing what I ""understood"" from this masterpiece.

Henry, the protagonist, goes through the horror of being a regular person stuck in the endless depression of the post-war era (probably), living in the middle of nowhere in a basic apartment with simple decor — a heater, a record player, and a painting of an atomic explosion.

In the middle of this painful existence, Henry is contacted by someone he probably would’ve never met again, but now they're forced to live together. Through experimental storytelling, Lynch shows what it’s like to be afraid of experiencing normal things — how someone’s perception can turn everything into a terrifying experience.

When Henry is faced with starting a family and raising a premature child — which he sees as some kind of alien, cadaverous, embryonic being — he slowly falls apart under the stress of daily life with his partner, in what feels like a twisted version of postpartum psychosis. In the middle of this post-punk horror, we witness the blurry line between normal human experiences and full-on nightmare fuel mixed with dreamlike beauty.

On a technical level, the noise sound design and use of shadows build a unique atmosphere that’s essential to the film’s impact. *Eraserhead* is one of those movies that sticks with you long after it's over.

movies,1lwops7,Movies that are quite similar yet polar opposites,"Just got out of a showing of Satoshi Kon's ""Perfect Blue"" (1997), and I was striked by how different yet a bit similar it is from his next movie ""Millenium Actress"" (2001). Both movies follow a rising actress, blend reality with fiction, and lead to some really interesting character introspection. Yet one is a crazy psychological thriller, a critique of the entertainment industry , while the other is a beautiful and bittersweet life story as well as a love letter to the history of the Japanese movie industry.

This got me thinking and I found another pairing from different directors : Celine Sciamma's ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019) and Robert Eggers' ""The Lighthouse"" (2019).
Both start with a really small and monosexual cast paired on an island, with growing romantic/sexual tension and growing feelings. Both use symbolism to their advantage (color/lights). Both show a careful attention to the crafting of their scene, especially with the lights placement, to give a painting vibe to it. Yet one is a beautiful love story that brings its two characters closer and closer before separating them, and the other a psychological horror tale leading to frustration then madness from both parts as they ultimately kill each other and get united for all eternity in a final terrifying shot.

Even if coincidental, I find this polar opposition quite funny. Any other examples ?

movies,1lwmof2,Charlie's friendship arc from Perks of Being a Wallflower makes no sense,"I really like a lot about The Perks of Being a Wallflower, but something has always bugged me—how quickly and easily Charlie, who is extremely introverted, anxious, and socially awkward, is accepted into a group of cool, older students.

He starts off the movie as a lonely freshman with serious mental health issues, clearly uncomfortable in social situations. And yet somehow, at a football game, he approaches seniors he doesn’t even know, and not only do they talk to him—they bring him to a party, introduce him to their whole friend group, and treat him like one of their own almost immediately.

I know part of the story is supposed to be about finding your people and being accepted, but this just felt a little too neat to me. High school social dynamics are rarely that open, especially across age gaps. Most freshmen wouldn’t have the nerve to approach seniors, and most seniors wouldn’t give them the time of day, let alone bring them into their lives overnight.

It just kind of broke the immersion for me. It felt more like wish fulfillment than something grounded in how people, especially teens, actually behave. I get that it’s fiction and maybe meant to be a bit idealized, but it stood out as one of the least believable parts of the story.

Anyone else feel this way? Or am I missing something?

movies,1lwle9u,Slurs in period pieces,"Films taking place in the past pretty much always have to show some unsavoury aspects from the time period. Even in nostalgic productions, they'll occasionally remind the audience that some modern notions were nonexistent back then. So I was wondering about those not-so-old movie, from the late-20th century, where characters drop some terms which most productions take great pains to avoid after they were declared offensive, insensitive, derrogatory, and the worst brand of all: a slur. But there was a time when some of these terms weren't considered that, or at worst, they were rude and mean, but not taboo tokens of bigotry; ""mentally ret-"" was a common term for people with intellectual disabilities until the late-2000's, and fa\*\*ot was a common insult for men and boys in those 80's productions, but now it's seen as one of the homophobic terms in English language, so unsurpringly, it doesn't appear much in later movies. And then there's the infamous N-word, which has been a taboo much longer, but how it's used has changed overtime. Some 70's and 80's productions would have racist characters use them in order to highlight their bigotry and even some family-friendly movies and series would use it in ostensibly anti-racism storylines. However, nowadays its use is far more restrict, to the point that it takes much greater context to make use of it.

So I was wondering how to handle period pieces set in times when those slurs were common, should they use such words to deict the context of time? After all, some productions want to make a faithful depiction of the time period, including highlighting the bigotry and lack of understanding about certain things, but then there's others which take a more nostalgic approach and so the worse aspects of the time tend to be toned down, in which I case I doubt they'd have any use for slurs.

Looking at her career right afterwards, and I see her taking some risks in some indie movies that nobody watched. Sure there's also ""Get Carter"" but that was also Sylvester Stallone on a downward shift in the late 90's. And the movie ""Anti-Trust"" is pretty much a YA Thriller that wants to be taken seriously.   
Anyways after the stinker ""Josie and the Pussycats"", it's pretty much clear she's now a ""has-been"" and has been starring is C-level productions ever since.  
With that being said, does Rachael Leigh Cook deserve another chance? I mean she's still making movies that nobody pays to watch, but I'd love to see her in something more meaningful. And to be fair, she's carved her way through the business where she didn't have to take her clothes off, and that's pretty rare by Hollywood standards.

movies,1lwdkzf,I finally got around to watching Oldboy - and it was not the kind of movie I was expecting,"It can sometimes be a little difficult these days to appreciate well-regarded classic cinema with truly fresh eyes and perspectives. Even if you haven't seen a particularly acclaimed movie, the prevalence of Reddit movie subs, YouTube move discussion channels and the popularity of Letterboxd means that you will almost inevitably absorb a lot of information on a popular classic just by osmosis. I think Oldboy definitely falls into this category of movies, where its towering reputation and sheer quantity of discourse in online film circles creates an almost outsized sense of expectation before you even start watching it. 

What I knew about Oldboy from said reputation was the following: dark, brutal, badass, iconic hallway fight scene, crazy twist and generally adored by young filmbro cinephiles. Going in, I kept my expectations in check as I thought I would probably get a dark, well-made revenge thriller and maybe not much more. 

Boy oh boy, was I ever wrong. I waited a bit to post my thoughts because after finishing the movie last night, I needed some time to process it, especially after those final 30 minutes.

Far from being ""just"" a revenge thriller, Oldboy actually turned out to be a grand human tragedy, a dark and bleak narrative of entwined fate and cycles of love-hate-love.

What stood out to me first and foremost is just how offbeat the whole atmosphere of it feels. Like it almost takes place in an off-kilter world just a bit removed from our own. The dark and moody visuals, with some truly inventive cinematography and shot composition, add to the overall atmosphere. The now-classic hallway fight scene is still amazing, and years of other media ripping it off hasn't really hurt it even a little bit. 

The story is fantastic, and where I was impressed the most. I kinda had the impression that the narrative would be really about Oh Dae-Su finding the people that imprisoned him and getting bloody revenge, but it's truly compelling in the way it keeps adding new wrinkles to the plot and then finally pulling the rug out from under you in the final act. In fact, up until the 3rd act, the movie was more along the lines of good-to-great to me. It really gets elevated to another level though when you find out the truth.

And man this was some dark, sick shit lol, just operatic and grandiose in its sheer twistedness. The discovery that this is all >!actually Lee Woo-jin's revenge!<, and not Oh Dae-Su's, and the sheer scope and extent of it, is breathtaking. A minor, careless sin committed by a clueless young boy that spiralled into a toxic ball of death and hate, consuming multiple lives into itself. It's rare that a movie will make me go ""holy shit"" these days, but Oldboy really managed it. It's not even the fact that >!Oh Dae-Su was made to commit incest with his daughter!<, but more everything that led to it. 

There is no catharsis here. No satisfaction from a well-planned and executed plot of righteous vengeance. It just leaves you feeling dirty and emotionally drained. 

Lee Woo-jin was just foreshadowing his own death in the end - revenge will heal you for a bit but the pain will never go away. You can cry and beg and self-mutilate all you want. The man walks away and the Monster remains. And Oldboy lives up to all of its hype.

1. **The films would have to be seen exclusively in the theater!**  *Any local theater* t*o include AMC, Regal, Cinemark, Look Cinema, Alamo Drafthouse, etc. Drive-in Theaters count!*
2. **Films seen on a streaming service DOES NOT count** (e.g. Netflix, MAX/HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Paramount+, AppleTV+, Peacock, etc)
3. **Any format is fine**; *e.g. Dolby Cinema, IMAX, RealD 3D, and Prime at AMC*
4. **Re-releases DOES NOT count, only new films of the year you're participating**
5. **Seeing a film multiple times DOES NOT count to your total films seen**
6. **Have to watch the entire film from beginning to the credits.** *Cannot walk out if you get bored or disinterested. Bathroom breaks is fine!*
7. **No limits on genre seen!!!**

*I should note that I live roughly 5 minutes from my local AMC theater which consists of 22 total screens of all auditorium sizes (small, medium, large), an IMAX, and a Dolby Cinema. And I'm also an AMC Stubs A\*LIST subscriber; a member since 2015, but subscriber for around a few years.* 😁

*So far, I've seen 50 films to date, and have planned out 36 more films in the coming days/months. I feel confident in reaching my 100 film goal by 31 DEC!! I've seen most of the AMC Screen/Scream Unseen films (mystery films) this year.*

movies,1lw9ul7,The Cost of Apathy Is Innocence,"Just finished watching Miracle in Cell No. 7 and I can’t stop thinking about the world we’ve built. It made me think of all the real life Cell No. 7s out there. Of how many people who are poor, misunderstood, disabled get swallowed by a system that was never designed to protect them. Of how often justice is loud for the privileged and deathly silent for the rest.

There were moments I forgot I was watching a movie. I was just feeling SO helpless so angry and shaken. Because how many people in this world are punished not for their crimes but for who they are. Poor. Invisible. Different.

This movie isn’t just about a father with a cognitive disability and his daughter. It’s a mirror held up to a world that still treats innocence as disposable. Especially when it comes wrapped in poverty or disability or difference. What shook me wasn’t just the injustice. It was how familiar it felt.

On the surface, it’s the story of a mentally challenged man falsely accused. A child torn from him. A courtroom that listens only to power. A prison cell that becomes a cathedral of unseen humanity. But beneath that, it is a philosophical, moral and emotional indictment of the systems we blindly trust. It asks what happens when justice is deaf to vulnerability. When poverty and disability become crimes. When the law becomes more obsessed with punishment than with truth.

A child forced to become the adult. A system that equates poverty with guilt. Disability with danger. Silence with consent. Yet amidst all the injustice, this film reveals something radical. The quiet power of human goodness in the darkest places. The resistance born inside those prison walls. From men branded as criminals who were more human than the ones in robes and positions of power. Strangers broken in their own ways who rose up to protect what the world tried to destroy.

And I couldn’t stop thinking how many people in our world today are living this same reality silently. Men, women, children erased not by death but by bureaucracy. By indifference. By the laziness of a world that no longer wants to look deeper.

There are Cell No. 7s in every country. In every city. In every place where kindness is mocked as weakness. Where intellect is prized over empathy. Where innocence is punished because it doesn’t speak the language of power. This film serves as a reminder: Justice is not a machine. It is a soul. And if we do not protect the innocent with vigilance, we are all complicit in silence in neglect in ease.

So if you watch this film, don’t just observe. Ask. Reflect. Question. Let your ache turn into awareness. Because the truest form of intelligence is not sharp logic or cold reason. It is the ability to recognize another’s pain and do something about it.

Sometimes the miracle isn’t in changing fate. It’s in refusing to let fate define you. Watch this movie not just with your eyes but with your heart.

We live in a world now where it is too easy to be cruel. Too profitable to be indifferent. Too fashionable to be detached. But that is exactly why we must fight harder to stay human. To feel deeply. To care loudly. To protect the soft and the vulnerable even when it’s inconvenient. Because if we don’t, then the real prisons aren’t just made of concrete. They are made of apathy. And we are already inside them. 

The most dangerous kind of injustice is the one we choose to ignore. Until empathy becomes a moral duty, we are all part of the injustice we claim to oppose and the innocent will keep paying the price for our indifference.",9,3,1752145321.0,Recommendation,0.64,True,False,Icy-Management-9749,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lw9ul7/the_cost_of_apathy_is_innocence/,new,low

movies,1lw6132,Two Really Boring Movies- Georgy Girl and Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore,"I watched both Georgy Girl and Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore this week and was so let down. I had recorded both from TCM a while ago so I’d have something good to watch during the summer.

Georgy Girl (1966)- a woman (Lynn Redgrave) is torn between her pregnant roommate’s husband and an older man (James Mason). 82% on Rotten Tomatoes

Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974)- A widow (Ellen Burstyn) packs her kid up and heads West in search of work as a singer. Along the way she has a couple of romances. 92% on Rotten Tomatoes

I was actually looking forward to watching Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore after having watched the series Alice, which is based on the film, during the pandemic. The series was by far more enjoyable, however it was a comedy while the movie was a romantic drama, although it is noted as a comedy. 

Both movies moved at a snail’s pace. With subject matter that should have been easy to write dynamic and interesting stories about, instead they were dull. With Georgy Girl we have a young female breaking societal norms and having an affair before marriage and with Alice we have a woman building a new life as a single mom and re-entering the dating world. 

I don’t mind movies or shows that are dialog driven or move at a slower pace, but at least have something interesting to say. The highlight of the viewing experience was hearing Dolly Parton’s I Will Always Love You in the Alice soundtrack. The title track for Georgy Girl is a bop too. 

All this said, I can see how for the time in which each was released they were important to the evolving culture and view on single women and sexuality, self-worth, and resilience. Unfortunately, neither really seems to hold up today. Although, Alice may speak more to those who have been in abusive relationships.

movies,1lw5xrm,Favorite movie by Asian country: Bhutan,"For those who haven't seen, I am seeking to find the [best movie from each country around the globe](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lth326/favorite_movies_from_each_country_asia_afghanistan/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), starting in Asia. Yesterday was the third day with Bangladesh. Today is Bhutan.

Our third day winner, from Bangladesh, is **The Clay Bird (2002) directed by Tareque Masud.** It was a beautiful war drama with a strong history about the beginnings of freedom for Bangladesh from Pakistan rule all from the lens of children. Great recommendation!

Okay let's do **Bhutan.**

It's another small country, located in the Himalayas, and heavily influenced by Buddhism. It is also quite secluded from the world. They prefer high value, low volume tourism and enact policies that keep the tourism very low as well as their relations with other countries being very light. They apparently didn't even allow television until 1999. All of this to protect it's peace and culture. This might be a fairly hard one, but let's see what Bhutan has to offer in film!

The rules:

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

49 minutes, 34 seconds after start of film:



\[Fletch is in an airplane hanger belonging to Boyd Aviation, in the Los Angeles area. He is posing as a technician who has come to assist one some repair work. He is looking inside the small airplane (a Cessna) that Alan Stanwyk uses as his personal aircraft. Two Boyd Aviation airplane technicians are present: ""Bud"" (played by Burton Gilliam) and ""Willy"" (Beau Starr).\]



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Looks well-used.



Technician Willy (Beau Starr): Goes back and forth to Utah every weekend.



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Oh is that right? What, is he a Mormon?



Technician Bud (Burton Gilliam): Ha ha! \[Laughs loudly.\]



Technician Willy: \[Laughs.\]



Technician Bud: I don't think he's doing a whole lot of singing with the Tabernacle Choir.



Technician Willy: These executives, they live high. You know what I mean?



Fletch (Chevy Chase): I sure do.



\[Long pause. Willy knows that Fletch is lying about who he is.\]



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Ah, that's a terrific wing. I love this shape.



\[Willy decides to test Fletch's knowledge of airplane mechanics, to confirm his suspicion that Fletch is not really who he says he is.\]



Technician Willy: Hey, do us a favor, pal.



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Name's Liddy. Gordon Liddy.



Technician Willy: Gord, take a look at the seventh Fetzer valve, will you. I think it's been sticking.



Fletch (Chevy Chase): \[Nods.\] Probably the humidity.



Technician Bud: \[Laughs.\] That's funny. No, what I think it is myself is the, uh, by-pass line.



Fletch (Chevy Chase): It could be the by-pass line. Yeah. Maybe I should take a look at it.



\[Nobody moves to assist Fletch. Fletch walks resolutely to the front of the airplane and lifts up an unlocked panel on the nose of the plane. It opens to reveal a storage area for luggage, clearly not where any sort of by-pass line might be found. Willy watches him closey.\]



Technician Bud: Uh, Gordo? \[Bud is still standing near the back of the airplane. He points to a spot near himself.\] Back here.



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Don't tell me my business, boy! Just checking the luggage. Somebody ought to clean these windows. There is a tremendous build up of gook all over them. \[Rubs his hand on the outside of a cockpit window.\] Look at that. \[Walking to the back of the plane.\] You use a lot of fuel to go to Utah?



Technician Bud: That's what I always ask.



Technician Willy: Burns enough to go to South America and back.



Fletch (Chevy Chase): South America and back? Huh? Is that right?



Technician Bud: Yeah. But I always kid him about it. I say, ""What are you doing up there? You doing some stunt flying or something?"" \[Laughs.\]



Fletch (Chevy Chase): \[Laughs.\] What's he say?



Technician Bud: Well, you know. He don't say nothing. He just gives me that look. You know, he's got that look. \[Tries to contort his face into ""that look.""\]



Technician Willy: Yeah, he don't say nothing. He just gives him that look.

Fletch (Chevy Chase): I'm gonna need some pliers and, uh, a set of 30-weight ball bearings.



Technician Bud: What?



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Yeah, uh... Tell you what. I gotta go to my truck. If Fred gets here before I'm back, you can tell him to start without me.



Technician Willy: What the hell do you need ball bearings for?



Fletch (Chevy Chase): Ah, come on guys... It's so simple. Maybe you need a refresher course. Hey! It's all ball bearings nowadays... Now, you prepare that Fetzer valve with some, uh, 3-in-1 oil and some gauze pads. And I'm gonna need about 10 quarts of antifreeze... preferably Prestone... No... No, make that Quaker State...

movies,1lvzxgg,Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind takeaways (about the nature of love),"i want to preface this by saying i'm open to all views about the movie and have tried to seek out opinions that differ from my own to give myself a full perspective.

**TW for those who love it** read at your own risk ig: I finished the movie and found it to be quite disappointing and bland, i was expecting it to be a worthwhile movie but i can't stand behind characters who knowingly choose to neglect growth and remain in ignorance and we're supposed to see that as a beautiful depiction of a realistic, flawed relationship. i didn't like clementine or joel (but didn't hate them i swear). i don't like people who can't make their mind up and i don't find flaky, impulsive/ reactive people like clementine instantly charming, magical or wonderful. i will never see the attraction between a person characterised as mundane/ sterile and a person characterised as willful and eccentric, both ways seem glaringly maladaptive. there's no wisdom in that because there's no harmony between the two. i will never romanticise a relationship were both knowingly merely use the other for comfort and avoid acknowleding their own flaws/ actually learning. it was a pretty flat watch for me. i can't understand how people would find this movie actually poignant. they deserved what they got because imo they never valued each other in the first place, in meeting for the next time after the memory erasure, they're devaluing each other from the start ie) how clementine goes on at him for using the word 'nice.' and that's all this movie felt like- nice. stale. un-revelatory- because it was so painfully obvious they weren't right for each other in any way.

i just can't imagine why anyone would idealise a relationship like that. like this is an academy award-winning film. A. O. Scott praised it as ""as unabashedly romantic as any movie you'll ever see."" it's not romantic, it's regressive. romance is not, 'i know we don't work well together, but let's try anyway even though we know better.' real love and romance is selfless, not turbulent. i'm not saying that instability is bad or you should give up on people/ relationships that aren't right, i'm saying you should respect people's differences and empathise with them rather than indulge them. uncritical love is so often romanticised it seems, but that's not true love, it's wishful thinking and a refusal to invite in outside reality and that's dangerous. it's attachment to each other and detachment from sense. true love is being able to say what you really think without it misfiring, real romance is when someone listens to you without only picking what they want to hear, it's genuine respect. Allowing people to hope for changes that may or may not come is not romance it's lack of respect, it's taking advantage of someone, and their time. Roger Ebert wrote: ""what remains constant is the human need for love and companionship, and the human compulsion to keep seeking it, despite all odds,"" but Joel and clementine don't seek love in each other, they just seek a kind of masochistic entertainment or a distraction.

i guess it's just i don't believe there is value in fooling yourself into happiness. the lyrics of the final scene- 'Change your heart Look around you Change your heart It will astound you I need your loving Like the sunshine' for me show how Joe was woefully fixated on clementine despite their best interests because he was genuinely holding onto the happy times. but that ultimately gives you a false idea of someone and a false sense of the relationship. i understand why he wants to hold onto that false sense, but it's disillusionment. one person on another reddit post said- 'The movie tries to prove that while people are messy and imperfect, there's still a chance for a brighter future as long as people are open enough to face the harsh truth,' (like how they say 'ok' to facing a imperfect relationship again with acceptance of it's imperfections). so i understand how people view this as romantic because they are at last actually committing to each other even with some knowledge of the unsavory parts of their relationship, and so this feels like progress, but it's really not to me. you're just trapping each other in something inherently unhealthy. it's even worse, kind of.

**TLDR:** I didn’t enjoy *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* because it felt like it romanticised an unhealthy relationship. Joel and Clementine don’t grow or learn from their mistakes, they knowingly return to the  relationship out of comfort and delusion. The film frames this as poignant, but to me it’s regressive and disempowering. I think real love requires clarity, mutual respect, and growth, it's not just a persisting uncritical attachment to someone or choosing to believe what you want to believe.",0,12,1752110023.0,Discussion,0.37,True,False,Impressive-Pen5698,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lvzxgg/eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind_takeaways/,new,low

movies,1lvz2u0,before sunset (2004),"TL;DR:
Watched Before Sunset nine years after seeing Before Sunrise, and I highly recommend spacing them out the way they were originally released. It makes the experience way more personal, you’ll pick up on deeper messages and naturally reflect on your own life as you grow alongside the characters.

I was 16 when I first watched Before Sunrise. My boyfriend at the time (shout out to him) introduced me to the trilogy.

When I found out there’s a huge gap between each film release and him raving that it’s one of the best romance trilogies ever I thought, cool, I’ll watch them spaced out the same way they were released. 

Today marks nine years since that first viewing, and I finally just got to watch Before Sunset. I’m honestly overwhelmed and emotional I had to make a Reddit post about it. It’s made me realize how much I’ve grown, how much has changed in my life, and how surreal it is to revisit these characters as they’ve aged. I think they’re supposed to be in their 30s now. I’m in my mid-20s, so I can’t fully relate, they’re talking about marriage and kids (well, he is) but still, watching them grow up and reconnect was just arghhhhh.

I fucking love her Celine. Some parts of her reminded me so much of myself. She’s relatable and inspiring all at once. After the movie, I just felt like shit, I want to do more with my life. She’s right, there’s so much I want to do, and I keep doing nothing. That part when she talks about being in Warsaw, where life just slows down and no one’s trying to sell you anything really stuck with me. Since 2016 it’s only gotten worse. It’s overstimulation everywhere, and somehow this movie literally just two people talking kept me off my phone the whole time. 
I felt like I was third-wheeling , and I loved it.

I loved how flirty they were. I feel bad for his wife, and I don’t support cheating but at the same time, these two were meant for each other. Why didn’t she show up??????? I get why she didn’t, but it’s so frustrating. Things could’ve been so different.

You can just see how much he loves her. Their awkwardness at the beginning felt so real like they didn’t know what to say after all that time. And then him doing everything he can just to keep the conversation going, to stay near her, it just felt so realistic.

I’m mad I deleted a paragraph I wrote earlier because I think it captured my final takeaway thoughts better. But I guess the heart of it is: there’s something magical about waiting between these films. I’m growing up while they’re growing up, and every time I come back to them, it makes me reflect in ways I didn’t expect.

Even if I’m not in their stage of life, I’m at a good age to watch this. It’s making me want to do things now paint, write, create, instead of sitting on all these dreams. It emphasised that I don’t want to live a life of regret. I want to fall in love and marry for love not just because it’s the “next step” or what’s expected. I don’t want marriage and kids just to check a box or prove something. I want them because they’re right for me. 

There were just so many key takeaways from their conversations I feel genuinely refreshed. But now I’m both excited and kind of scared, because ten years until the next one means so much could change. He was right when he said nine years passed and it felt like two months. It really does. It feels like I was 16 just yesterday, and now I’m 25. This movie made me reflect deeply on what I’ve achieved, how my life has shifted, what I want for myself, and what I expect from myself moving forward.

It also makes me wonder what will I surprise myself with in the next ten years? Will I still be working full-time? Will I have kids? Will I be in a happy marriage? Still living in London? Still have red hair? So many questions but I guess I get to shape it all. It will all just be an outcome of my decisions.

Part of me thought I should rewatch Before Sunrise, but I think I won’t. I kind of want to watch each film only once. I’ll take what I need from them when it’s time maybe I’ll do a full rewatch after the third.

Celine’s right — what’s lost is lost. You can’t meet the same person twice so I’d rather just watch it once to get what I need and idealise that moment. 

Now I guess I wait till 2035 to watch the last one. Ten years. That’s insane especially after that cliffhanger like what!!!!! ",7,4,1752107570.0,Discussion,0.69,True,False,X-Cessive-,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lvz2u0/before_sunset_2004/,new,low

movies,1lvyfa6,Best examples of perfect casting?,"Actors who completely embodied the role of their characters. Actors who gave such an amazing performance that no one else could have played their role. 

One that comes to mind is Jeff Bridges in The Big Lebowski. It helps that the role was written specifically with him in mind, but still. It is absolutely his most iconic role and for good reason. He is not playing a part in that film. He IS that character. He might just be playing himself, but he is so natural. As a matter of fact, another example of perfect casting lies within that movie as well, with John Goodman as Walter. I can’t imagine anyone else playing that role. He is by far the funniest part of the entire movie. 

Other examples without making this post an essay:

J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Terrence Fletcher

Matthew Lillard as Shaggy

Al Pacino as Michael Corleone

Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview",127,352,1752105685.0,Discussion,0.84,True,False,Stankassmfgorilla,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lvyfa6/best_examples_of_perfect_casting/,new,low

movies,1lvq86j,I don't understand the appeal of seeing a movie because of movie stars. I do for the crew.,"I get that people are generally able to perform the suspension of disbelief to see a character instead of an actor. However when there's an instantly recognizable star in the role instead of a no-name, that just makes that a little bit harder. Part of the appeal for indie movies like Blue Ruin for me was that I'd never seen any of the actors in anything else before so I could instantly get further into it without the back-of-mind distractions of the lead's previous roles. 

I also understand that people want an assurance of a certain quality standard or to see familiar faces acting in a familiar way, but that's way more likely to come from the creative vision behind the camera than in front of it, from like screenwriters or directors monitoring the dialogue and mannerisms of the performance. Like it's a common saying whenever  a movie star off camera expresses a political belief that someone finds disagreeable that they should ""just say (their) lines."" 

It's why when it became a popular talking point that stars don't create box office and intellectual properties/franchises do, I thought that was the much more sensible way for audiences to choose their moviegoing experiences.

movies,1lvouch,'How the Sausage Gets Made' Movies,"What are the best 'how the sausage gets made' films, by which I mean films that show characters performing duties in such a way that you gain an understanding of how the job works.

Prime examples:

THE TRAIN (1964) with Burt Lancaster and Paul Scofield, directed by John Frankenheimer.  
The film concerns a train station in WW2.  Nazis are moving stolen artwork through the station and Lancaster, the station manager, is tasked with stopping them.  Through the course of the movie, the viewer really gets into the weeds with how the station itself works and, to a lesser degree, how a WW2 era train works.  Great stuff and an excellent film.

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN (1980) with Kirk Douglas and Martin Sheen, directed by Don Taylor.  
The film concerns the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier.  A time vortex opens and the carrier gets sent back to 1941 and the captain and crew must decide whether or not to interfere with history.  The plot itself is secondary to the military porn on display: there's a huge focus on showing how the launch and retrieval process works for fighter craft and it's really quite stupendous.  It's really a pretty cool movie all in all.

UNITED 93 (2006), directed by Paul Greengrass.  
The film concerns the plight of United Airlines flight 93 during the 9/11 attacks.  Much of the film takes place in the aircraft control tower with a lot of 'behind the scenes' authenticity showing how aircraft controllers actually do their job.  Excellent and moving film.

What are some other great examples that really show how things get done?

Side note: if you've never seen THE TRAIN, remedy that oversight.  It's part of Frankenheimer's incredible run of films in the 1960s.

movies,1lvoojf,"""Supergirl"" (1984) is universally loathed yet is it possible it is a misunderstood film? Can anyone see the good in the often maligned DC film?","Helen Slater was the best Supergirl we got in Celluloid. She was mesmerizing. Beautiful, likable and she can act. Considering ""Supergirl"" was her first film, she kept the film together and held her own against legends like Peter O'Toole. 

I loved the Phantom Zone scenes, dark and gritty, almost scary, and O'Toole made the most out of his tragic figure. 

I wish they had gone with a villain from the comics, however as a gay male, Faye Dunaway's Selena was a gift from the gods. Her wardrobe, kaftans and tunics, the Eleanor Parker wig, being a sex-starved nympho whose main goal is world domination ans boinking the studly lumberjack, played by Hart Bochner (think David Schwimmer but handsome and sexy), lives in a fairgroung with her blowsy sidekick, played by Brenda Vaccaro (in full tampax voice mode) and Peter Cook as Selena's former beau, saying SEEElena every five minutes. I was in heaven. 

You also get a coming of age subplot about Supergirl AKA Linda Lee realizing she's a woman who likes sex and dealing with bitchy, mean girls at a boarding school. She occasionally fights monsters sent by a scorned Dunaway who couldn't find wire hangers for her revenge and Christina  was still at Chadwicks so she couldn't be PUHnished.

movies,1lvebjj,"I didn't expect to be as moved by a film as I did with ""Awakenings"" (1990). Touching, occasionally emotionallly manipulative yet absorbing. Robert De Niro, as usual, surprises when not typecast","I like Robert De Niro as an actor, especially when he drifts away from the gangster roles he's famous for.  You usually don't associate Robert De Niro with sensitive roles or parts which demand a lot of emotional gravitas yet he did play those parts and always accomplished those demands. 

In ""Awakenings"", he plays a longtime patient, Leonard, victim of encephalitis lethargica, which placed himself in a catatonic state for most of his life. When he gets a (temporary) cure which takes Leonard back into a state of rationality, he's faced with being ""normal"" again however with the realization of the years he lost and worse, with the possibility he might go back into being how he was. 

The cast is excellent. Everybody delivers a stirring turn: De Niro, Robin Williams (a brilliant comedian who could surprise you as a wonderful dramatic actor), Julie Kavner (solid support for Williams), Penelope Ann Miller (underrated actress who shares with De Niro the saddest scene of the film) and Ruth Nelson (fabulous as a elderly parent whose personal identity is unraveled when her son gets well and she doesn't know how to cope).

movies,1lve4eg,"""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) - A epic, grand Western which revived the genre and made Kevin Costner into the ultimate actor-director of his generation","I was won over by the opening act, when Kevin Costner's Lt. John Dunbar goes suicidal as he rides his horse with open arms and the music of John Barry swoons. 

Everything else afterwards paled by comparison. As the story continues, with John Dunbar travelling into the American Frontier, coming in contact with the Lakota and changing his life as a result does end up going into the trope of the White Savior. Dunbar becomes ""Dances with Wolves"", falls for a white woman who got kidnapped as a child and became part of the tribe (a winning Mary McDonnell) and becomes a integral part of the group, helping the Lakota in catching the Buffalos, going into war with the American soldiers, learning about the struggle of the Native Americans within the environment.

A far cry from the racist Westerns made popular for decades within the Industry. The film is more understanding in offering a perspective of the Native American yet still places a Caucasian male at the center of the story. 

Either way, it's beautifully films and for the time, more progressive. Kevin Costner is good as Dunbar, Mary McDonnell is wonderful in a role I wish had been more explored and strong supporting turns from Graham Greene and Tantoo Cardinal. 

Dean Semler's cinematography is majestic and wide, a film which even when the dialogue or acting isn't always appealing, the imagery is prepossessing enough to distract you from any of its flaws.

Yesterday was the second day with Bahrain. Today is Bangladesh. 

Our second day winner, from Bahrain, is **Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford.** I know nothing about this movie other than it apparently is a Disney movie, yet sadly not on Disney Plus. It is not on 1337x. If anyone has access on how to view it, feel free to comment. 

Okay let's do **Bangladesh.**

It's a little country east of India that oftentimes lingers in India's shadow. So let's let this beautiful country stand on its own today in film!

The rules:

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

movies,1lva1ze,The Substance (abuse of Stabilizer),"I mean, I get why they made the plot the way they did, but... I also kinda wonder if, instead of Elisabeth ""living vicariously"" through Sue and, perhaps naively, letting her ""off the hook"" for so long, wrt abuse of the Stabilizer, she didn't, like, at some point, decide to ""take revenge"" on Sue, to some extent, and start abusing the Stabilizer \*herself\*, perhaps only switching a month later than she should've (and, thusly, quite-possibly become a lot more-youthful in the process *while conscious as Elisabeth, thereby allowing Elisabeth to also, ""have some of the fun""*)

Like, after Elisabeth had that phone call with the guy at the Substance company (after her leg got all fucked-up, if memory serves), I thought, ""Surely, at this point, she'll WAKE TF UP and stop hoping/assuming that Sue will, get her shit together and 'respect the process'?""  But... like a ""dumbass"", Elisabeth just hopes for the best and lets Sue screw her over more and more.

I couldn't help but wonder, ""Might the movie also work well, to some extent, *if* the people who made it, rather, had Elisabeth start abusing the process *herself* a bit, if only to get revenge on Sue and show her, 'This is what happens if you fuck with and take advantage of me!  Don't push your luck!'?""  Imho, the movie could've been just as interesting, quite possibly, if they added an element of, ""inter-consciousness"" or ""inter-body"" conflict between Sue and Elisabeth, after Elisabeth decided to start abusing the Stabilizer like Sue did for so long.  Like a sort of ""Stabilizer/youth arms race"", so to speak... until they ultimately ""fuck up too much"" and go to a 'point of no return' anyway

Some might argue that it would ""detract"" from the overall message or meaning of the film, but... would it, necessarily (if done right)?  Still, for Elisabeth, presumably, to be written in such a way as to ""not even consider"", at the very least, abusing the Stabilizer with Sue, seems like a missed opportunity?  If any one of us were Elisabeth, we'd probably ask ourselves, ""Why not fight fire with fire"", at some point?

Then again, for all we know, maybe the studio and writers *did*, in fact, consider that as a plot point but rejected it?  I guess we can only speculate on that...

Or did I miss something and, in fact, it was the case that the ""Stabilizer youthfulness"", for the 2, only went one way (i.e. Sue being able to extract more Stabilizer to stay conscious \*and\* be very-youthful, whereas, perhaps, Elisabeth didn't quite have the option of being able to ""become more youthful"" and/or stay conscious beyond the week-long period by abusing)? Like, in theory, when the 2 became ""totally separate"" individuals, why wouldn't we have reason to believe that Sue's ""essence"" was also ""ripe for the taking"", just as Sue had done to Elisabeth?",0,10,1752036444.0,Discussion,0.27,True,False,JohnEGirlsBravo,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lva1ze/the_substance_abuse_of_stabilizer/,new,low

The movie was from the 2000s, and it was Balkan (Maybe bosnian) set on the Austrian border, I think. All I clearly remember is that it was definitely set on a border.

The premise is that a man tries to get his terminally ill brother across the border so he can receive treatment , but he can’t because his brother doesn’t have the correct papers. Because of this, he starts crying while trying to comfort his brother. One of the guards wants to let him through, but his superior won’t allow it.

The landscape, to my knowledge, featured lots of mountains. I believe the film was either made in the late '90s or early 2000s. I remember seeing it on TikTok and then looking it up on YouTube, where I watched it. However, I’ve since tried using ChatGPT and checking my search history, and I still can’t find anything.

Death Becomes Her (1992) original ending I like better than what they used. Both are still gorgeous 59 Years Later because the potion they took doesn't let them age, sitting on a balcony asking what they should do

London? We've done London so many times Paris? We went three years ago and saw everything. 

They then see an old couple, Ernest w his wife. He holds her hand gently with love in his eyes the years have brought them

Madeline: Aren't you glad that's not us? 

Helen: (Longingly, her tone betraying her) Yeah

movies,1lv2udy,Is having some characters die really that necessary if you want to have tension?,"Some of the complaints I've seen, mostly in movies, are when it comes to action scenes, or any type of scene that is supposed to be tense, people can't feel the tension because a) the story doesn't kill off any character, b) the story is killing only the characters with the least amount of characterization, c) the main characters get killed only if they allow that to happen (e.g. a self-sacrifice). And people tend not to feel tension during these scenes. I am especially seeing this right now with the discourse around Jurassic World: Rebirth.

Now, I do agree that killing off main characters helps raise the stakes of the story... Am I the only one who doesn't feel the need to have MCs getting killed? I mean, I get that it is a great plot device for making tension, but isn't it enough to show that death in the story is possible, or that at least the characters can get hurt? And I did experience tension in movies due to the situations looking very hard to survive from.

Am I not used to this trope enough, and that's why I can feel tension even without MCs dying, or killing off important characters isn't the only way tension can be built?

1. Award Winner - One Must Be a film for which the actor received an Awards nomination, be it Academy Awards or Golden Globes

2. Box Office Smash – Need to have Made 200 Million at the Box Office 

3. Two Hander – A movie where the actor stars opposite another major movie star

4. Auteur Turn – A movie where the actor works with an Auteur Director 

5. Comedy – Every serious Actor of the last 40 years – This doesn’t mean the movie itself necessarily is a comedy, but the Actor has to give a comedic performance, intentionally or not. 

6. Bit Part – This Can be either a brief cameo appearance in the movie or an appearance as part of a larger ensemble

7. Flop – Even our biggest stars have a few flops interspersed throughout their careers and Hackman is so different – the key to this category is choosing a FLOP that is still somehow watchable
 
8. Wild Cards- Dealer's choice

9. Wild Card – Dealer's choice.

movies,1luyzd0,Why Paul Mescal worked in gladiator II,"Now I'm aware there are many different opinions on the film itself, and on that, I'm a bit conflicted.  
I personally thought all that water CGI fest was too much.

However, Paul Mescal was brilliant, and it took me a while to figure out why I liked him in it.  
Knowing Ridley Scott, I went into this film not expecting a lot of deep character work.  
We have bad guys and good guys in Ridley Scott films.

We also had that in this, but Paul layered his hero portrayal with something that Russell Crowe didn't.  
The ""nothing to lose"" part is something he really shined through.

Paul's character is dangerous; he is not a classic hero—you want to stay out of his way.  
He felt unsafe, and it was refreshing compared to the classic 'hero of the story' to have a guy that made you a little uneasy.

I credit all this to Paul's performance because the script and movie make a big deal out of him being a hero.  
He doesn't want to kill unless he has to, he wants to save everyone, yada yada, classic boy scout.  
But Paul added some recklessness and danger to that, in my opinion, that made the portrayal really strong.

movies,1luy53s,I hated 17 again.,"I hated 17 Again.

You all know this. It’s a summer day—a really tiring summer day—and you’re just sitting on the couch, bored as hell, wondering what you’re gonna do with your life. So you open Netflix, start scrolling, and then you see this: Seventeen Again. It’s a really old movie. But you decide, hmm, what do I have to lose? Apparently everything.

Starting that movie, it was fine. At least, that’s what I thought. But nooooo. The first few beginning minutes were like, oh, I feel a little bad for the main character, but, you know, he kind of had it coming. Because what do you mean you’re doing unprotected boombayah at 17? Who does that? Well, nowadays people do that, but the movie was from, like, back in 2015 and stuff. But like, let’s be real. Let’s freak it up a bit.

So I watch it, wondering, hmm, maybe it’s gonna get better. Then he becomes 17 again—like the title says—goes back to school, and there, I meet the most hated character in my life.

Oh wait—maybe I was a little too hasty. Let’s go back a little. In the beginning scenes, we’re introduced to the main character’s family: the mom (they’re about to divorce) and his two children. We get undertones of how unhappy they are with their father. Like, yeah, you know, typical pre-divorce situation. All that stuff. But besides that, those two characters? I don’t even deign -remember their names. I was like, hmm, maybe they’re gonna be a big part of the story.

So, let’s go back again. When he turns 17 again and goes back to school, he meets his son. He acts awkward, the son runs away, all that. But I’m talking about the bathroom scene—where he sees his son being taped to a chair or toilet or whatever. And I’m like, wait, maybe he’s gonna learn that his son is being bullied and help him. That’s gonna be the gist of the story—how family matters the most.

And then I was like, okay, yeah, but NO. Yeah, it’s about that—but I then have to find out that his main bully is dating his sister.

Y’all remember that he had a son and a daughter, right? Yes, that’s what happened. He has a son and a daughter. The son is being bullied, and the daughter is dating the bully. Because I remember looking at that and I was shook. I was shook. I was shook. I was baffled.

And I remember reading a story on Reddit about how this girl got bullied by a guy, and her sister still decided to date him—and how she cut contact because of that. And I’m saying: this movie does not address it at all.

Like, why is your sister dating your bully? Why is she not doing anything about it? That’s not even the tip of the iceberg. And let me not even get started on the uncomfortable relationship between the guy—who now appears as a teen—and the mom.

Because I get it… not really, I don’t. I don’t get it. But like, yes, the dad knows that he’s internally an adult. But the mom doesn’t. She sees him as a teenager. Like, the literal 17-year-old he looks like. But still, there are undertones of romance in their interactions whenever they meet, and that’s weird. Awkward. Disgusting. I don’t like it. I hated it.

And I can rant and rant and rant about how much I hated it, but the part that pissed me off the most was how they never addressed how what the sister was doing was wrong.

She’s not a good person. Imagine your sibling is getting bullied—and the person bullying them is your boyfriend—and you know he’s doing it. He does it in front of you. Somehow, you still let it happen.

And I hated it. I hated it, I hated it, I hated it. That’s why I hated that damn movie.

Well, with all the other problematic things inside, the only normal person in that movie is the brother. Because he’s the only one who had a normal relationship—with the girl he liked and everything.

And I’m just saying—why? Why did the movie have to be so weird? And this is the reason why I do not like 17 Again.

So I was talking to my sister about how whatever was going on in the movie producer’s head was not it—especially with where they decided to place the romance. And then, when I pointed out that the relationship between the main character and his ex—or soon-to-be ex-wife—was weird because he has the form of a teenage boy, she was like, “I don’t see the problem.”

And I’m like, what do you mean? I said, imagine she kissed him when he was in that teenage form.

She was like, “Well, he’s still her husband.”

I’m like, so imagine you were a 36-year-old woman, and your husband became 17 again. You would still kiss him?

So am I wrong for thinking it’s weird? Or is she weird for thinking it’s fine?

Because like—what? Why are you people like this? Why does she think it’s normal? It’s not! ",0,19,1752003581.0,Discussion,0.14,True,False,Levi_riu_22,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1luy53s/i_hated_17_again/,new,low
movies,1luy3g8,"TIFU - took my wife on a date to see “From Hilde, With Love” - a short review.","This movie is billed as being a daring romance with elements of espionage - set during the resistance in Berlin during the Second World War. 

It is not. 

Spoilers -
While it is a very topical movie with a timely message, it is an extraordinarily depressing tale of one woman’s existence in Nazi prisons while she raises a baby while waiting the death penalty. Her romance with her husband is shown in flashbacks, but there is no chemistry between the leads and after he is executed, she just stoically gets on with it. Therefore, no romance. The espionage bit is basically just them typing in morse code, trying to reach the Soviets, but in the end their radio was too weak to send but a single message.  No thrilling espionage.

While it is pretty clear what Hilde’s fate is going to be, it is shown very starkly. 

I can’t really say I enjoyed it. It is very scary, because people were given the death penalty for basically putting up stickers over Nazi propaganda and listening to a certain radio programme. It isn’t too much of a stretch to see that pattern repeating itself. 

TLDR: good movie, but definitely NOT for a date and not what it says on the tin. ",82,9,1752003475.0,Discussion,0.76,True,False,DiscoPopStar,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1luy3g8/tifu_took_my_wife_on_a_date_to_see_from_hilde/,new,low

[Variety (80)](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/)

>The super-busy quality of “Superman” works for it and, at times, against it. The movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. That’s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (“The Dark Knight,” “Superman II,” “The Batman,” “Guardians”). I’d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes “Iron Man,” “Thor,” “Batman Begins,” “Captain America,” and the hugely underrated “Iron Man 3”). Yet watching “Superman,” we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we’re drawn right inside them. Gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that’s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure

[The Hollywood Reporter (80)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-james-gunn-1236305764/)

>What matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads.

[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-reboot-1236450641/)

>Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times *Superman* suffers from overload, much like Gunns’ *Guardians of the Galaxy* trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the *Babe: Pig in the City* treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran’s) more hopeful vision.

[Indiewire (58)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/superman-movie-review-james-gunn-1235137386/)

>Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman’s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what’s at stake. It’s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you’re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it’s hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it’s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn’t any gravity to the world around him. Grade: C+

[IGN (8)](https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult)

>Superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the Man of Steel, and a great new start for the DC universe on the big screen.

[The Atlantic (90)](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/)

>The First Superman Movie Worth Watching in Years. The newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness.

[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-2025/)

>Grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. There are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.

[Collider (80)](https://collider.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-dc-david-corenswet/)

>Superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the Man of Steel fascinating in a way we’ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. Gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world’s future, crafting an introduction to the DCU that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. At this point, it’s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. But Gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to Superman. It ends up becoming one of the best DC films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer.

[The Guardian - UK (2/5)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn)

>From the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times.

[The Wrap (88)](https://www.thewrap.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet/)

>A fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard… which are the best flaws a film can have.

[Entertainment Weekly (67)](https://ew.com/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-soar-kryptonite-script-11768207)

>Whether Gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. Because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. With a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film — if only Gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first. **Grade: B-**

[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250708-superman-review)

>It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. Corenswet is well cast – he has plenty of all-American charm both as Superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, Clark Kent – but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys Lois Lane's company. We don't see any of that. Indeed, Corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. Was Gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show Superman's sweeter and nobler side? Maybe so. In a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a Man of Steel who keeps having meltdowns.

[Empire Magazine - UK (2/5)](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/superman-2025/)

>David Corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of Gunn’s signature sense of fun shine through — but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn’t work.

[Rolling Stone (80)](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-1235374965/)

>It’s faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He’s given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.

[SlashFilm (80)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1906722/superman-james-gunn-movie-review/)

>Yes, ""Superman"" is a frequently corny movie because Superman is a corny character, a Kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. There's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. In our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold.

[Independent - UK (4/5)](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-b2782165.html)

>David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult lead a movie that doesn’t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of DC as a whole.

[New York Times (90)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html)

>As both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we’ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition.

[Vulture (90)](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html)

>There’s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. But the film’s approach isn’t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.

[The Times - UK (2/5)](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/superman-film-review-david-corenswet-vbzrgpdhh)

>This migraine of a movie is superhero soup. David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood’s latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush

[The Irish Times (2/5)](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/07/08/superman-review-utterly-charmless-and-as-funny-as-toothache/)

>The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.

movies,1luukji,"The more I watch Lewis Pullman, the more blown away I am","I made a post a while back about Lewis Pullman but I wanted  to come back and update because I keep being more and more blown away by him.

Like I mentioned before, I was first introduced to him through Top Gun Maverick. Even with limited screen time, he completely owned that role. There was something so endearing and sweetly innocent in his performance that really stood out. It’s rare for a “smaller” role to leave such a lasting impression, but he did just that.

Recently I watched The Starling Girl, and wow that performance really blew me away. His acting chops were fully on display. I love how understated he is while still bringing so much depth, passion and emotion. He never overplays it, but the impact lands hard.

I’ve also now watched Outer Range thanks to recommendations- what a cast, what a plot. Everyone was brilliant (Josh Brolin is a total badass), but once again I found myself especially drawn to Lewis’s character and screen presence.

I also really enjoyed what he brought to his character in Skincare. I love Elizabeth Banks, and this was very different from his other roles- more bold, eccentric, and slightly unhinged. But he still made it feel natural and believable, in that effortless understated signature Lewis Pullman way.

There’s something so lovely about watching him work. He says a lot without having to say a lot. I know this post is wordy and the opposite of that but I had to put it out there because he really deserves the recognition.

I genuinely hope he stays grounded and doesn’t get tainted by the industry. He seems like a kind person with integrity and that really comes through in interviews and the roles he chooses.

I haven’t seen all of his work yet, but I’m enjoying working through it. Everything I’ve seen so far has stayed with me. He brings a quiet sincerity and charm that’s rare.

I’m excited to see what he does next. He’s definitely one to watch and I think he should be so incredibly proud of himself. I love that his choices lean toward thoughtful interesting challenging stories and complex characters rather than flashy blockbusters. I hope he keeps following that path and stays true to himself, it’s clearly working.

For context: I’m in my 30s and pretty old school having spent a lot of my life really influenced by my dad and having shared passions. I usually don’t connect much with younger talent (no disrespect, just personal taste, I tend to gravitate toward older generation actors and musicians). But Lewis Pullman is definitely an exception. There’s something quietly special about what he brings and it really sticks with you. It definitely sticks with me.

If anyone has any recommendations or insights to share please do!? I’d love to hear more about his work. 
I’d honestly love to tell him all this in person someday, just so he knows the impression he’s leaving on people and his audience, but I hope he already knows. His parents must without a doubt be so proud of him

**Bio and more information:**

From Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy Award-winning writer/producer/director Larry Charles, COMEDY SAMURAI: 40 YEARS OF BLOOD, GUTS, AND LAUGHTER is a rollicking journey through modern American comedy, as he shares behind-the-scenes stories from his life\&#39;s work.

Grand Central will publish Charles’s memoir on June 17, 2025. To tell Larry Charles’s life story is to tell the story of modern American comedy. Over the last 40 years, few comedians have been a part of so many iconic, beloved projects. Larry was one of the original writers and producers on the first five seasons of Seinfeld, executive produced both Curb Your

Enthusiasm and Entourage while directing 18 episodes of Curb and served as the showrunner for Mad About You. His film directing credits include Borat, Bruno, and The Dictator, the comic documentary Religulous (starring Bill Maher), and Masked and Anonymous (which he co-wrote with Bob Dylan who stars).

In Comedy Samurai, Charles pulls back the curtain on the making of his successful projects, offering sharp, never-before-told anecdotes about Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Bill Maher, Bob Dylan, Nic Cage, Mel Brooks, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, and Larry David, among many others.

Larry Charles rose from the mean streets of Brooklyn and the working-class housing projects of Donald Trump’s nefarious father Fred, to become the director of Borat, Bruno, The Dictator and Religulous amongst others. He directed Bob Dylan and an all-star cast (Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Jessica Lange and Penelope Cruz among others) in the film, Masked an Anonymous which he and Dylan wrote together. He has also directed numerous episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm and was one of the original writers and producers of Seinfeld. Larry is a Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy-award winner. Since the Malibu fires, he, and his wife and two dogs are vagabonds.

movies,1lumfmn,"Kurt Vonnegut's novels that have been adapted to the big screen: Slaughterhouse-Five (1972), Mother Night (1996) and Breakfast of Champions (1999).","Kurt Vonnegut is easily one of my favorite authors. So it goes. His novels have both made me laugh out and loud as well as shed tears. I took it upon myself to look at the 3 adaptions of his novels with *Slaughterhouse-Five,* *Mother* *Night* and *Breakfast* *of* *Champions* and look at how they went about adapting Vonnegut's unique voice and what may have been lost in adaption.

First, we have *Slaughterhouse*\-*Five*, easily Vonnegut's most well-known and read novel, one that has a big place in literary history. The novel, concerning the character of Billy Pilgrim being ""unstuck in time"" and based on the real-life bombing of Dresden (which Vonnegut witnessed as a POW), was released in 1969, proving to be such a hit that it was turned into a film only 3 years later. The film adaption would be directed by George Roy Hill, best known for *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969), for which he won the Oscar for Best Director. The film adaption was well received by critics, winning the *Prix du Jury* at the Cannes Film Festival. So it goes. Even more of a glowing commendation came from Vonnegut himself, who said he couldn't be happier with how his novel was adapted. Watching the film and I am impressed by how closely they stuck to the novel and the casting was pretty damn good. However, I find that it's one of those films that fails to live up the heights of the novel, especially when it came to how I pictured certain parts and characters as I read it. I'd recommend it to fans of the novel, with the caveat that it isn't the same as reading the novel.

Secondly, we have *Mother* *Night*, which has the biggest gap from the novel to the film adaption of Vonnegut's works, with the novel being published in 1962 and the film being released in 1996. The novel is about Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American who lives in Germany with his family since post-WW1, who becomes recruited by American Intelligence to become a double-agent, broadcasting Nazi Propaganda while secretly communicating with the Americans about Nazi plans. The film was directed by Keith Gordon, who is most known for his role as Archie Cunningham in *Christine* (1983), but had directed a few indie flicks before adapting Mother Night. This is my favorite adaption of the 3 films and it's especially due to Nick Nolte's fantastic performance as Howard W. Campbell Jr. Nolte brings his trademark rage and sense of self-loathing to the role with aplomb. Nolte really makes this a one-man show but their are some nice supporting performances by Sheryl Lee, Alan Arkin, Frankie Faison and John Goodman. This adaption was also well received by critics and Vonnegut also commended the film for how it adapted his novel. So it goes. 

Finally, we have *Breakfast of Champions*, the novel being published in 1973 and the film being released in 1999. The novel and film concerns itself with Dwayne Hoover, a well respected businessman whose mental health deteriorates over the course of the novel; the novel also looks at the city Dwayne lives in, Midland City, as well as exploring the various people that make up the city; also, the novel feature Kilgore Trout, the biggest reoccurring character in Vonnegut's 'Verse, who's a curmudgeonly writer on his way to Midland City for an Arts Festival. The film was directed by Alan Rudolph, a longtime director of indie films in various genres. The film was roundly panned by critics. So it goes. I find this adaption to be the most frustrating, as while it has some of comedy of the novel, it completely misses the pathos. The film also suffers from changing various elements of the novel, cutting out crucial scenes of adding whole new ones. Despite the overall disappointment I found in the film, I did come away liking some of the performances. I thought Bruce Willis did a fair job at portraying Dwayne Hoover as Willis used some of his natural comedic timing to pull off Hoover's decreasing mental state. The incomparable Albert Finney does well in the time he's given as Kilgore Trout. Nick Nolte gets the chance to play a zanier role as the crossdressing Harry LeSabre, with Nolte really excelling with the comedic bits.

movies,1luj74t,Somehing felt weird watching the last Mission Impossible movie,"^(Obligatory sorry for weird english)

I went to see the last Mission Impossible movie with my father last sunday, in a theater in France. In this movie, countries with nuclear weapons are mentionned often, and there are maybe three or four moments when we see a serie of flags being shown quickly (if you saw the movie, you know what I'm referring to).

Now, the first time this happened in the movie, I thought I missed the French flag. Maybe I blinked at the wrong moment. Then it happens a second time and there, I pay attention : no French flag!

Wait, it's weird, why would they show the 6 or 7 other flags but not the French one? 

Then all the other moments when this shot is shown in the movie, I really pay close attentin : no French flag. I am sure of it.

movies,1luj3qw,"Which actors do you only ever see as themselves, and which completely disappear into their roles?","Had a chat with my fam about this the other night while watching a film. For whatever reason, with some actors, no matter what film I’m watching with them in it, I don’t see the character, I just see the actor.


Sometimes it’s because they basically play themselves every time, or they’re typecast into the same type of role over and over. Other times it’s just their massive star power overshadowing the entire film.


For example, Marilyn Monroe - one of the earliest examples of this. Hell yeah, she was a great actress, but in every film, all I see is Marilyn. I can never even remember her characters’ names because it’s just her.


Perfect example: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson...he’s been playing himself since the mid-2000s. imo Jack Black too. Jeff Goldblum feels like he’s parodying himself these days. And as much as I love Bruce Willis (😢) after Die Hard, 90% of his roles felt like slight variations of a cavalier John McClane. Pacino too - after Scent of a Woman, all I see is Pacino being Pacino. Watching Tom Cruise in a movie these days feels like Tom Cruise doing cool Tom Cruise things, and as hilarious as I find Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is basically Van Wilder in a suit. I don't mean to bash on any of them at all, I've enjoyed every single one, i just thought it interesting to point out. 


But then you've got absolute superstars like DiCaprio, one of the most recognizable faces on the planet, yet when I watch his movies, I don’t see Leo, I see his characters. Same with guys like Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale, who completely vanish into whoever they’re playing.


Funny enough, Johnny Depp used to be on that list for me. the king of vanishing into a role. But now, even though he looks nothing like himself under all that makeup, i'm still sitting there in the theatre like: “yep, that’s Johnny Depp doing his thing.”


Nicolas Cage is the wildcard. Sometimes I can’t get past that it’s just Nic Cage being Nic Cage, other times his performance is so phenomenal I completely forget it’s him...or maybe because it’s actually John Travolta, playing Nic Cage, playing John Travolta…


What about you guys? Which actors can you never unsee, and which ones completely vanish into their characters for you?",264,491,1751962591.0,Question,0.82,True,False,Agile-Tie-7433,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1luj3qw/which_actors_do_you_only_ever_see_as_themselves/,new,low
movies,1luj234,What are these type of one on one fight scenes called? (Fight scenes),"Their are some fight scenes in movies/shows I’ve seen where the fight goes from one part of an area too an entirely different part of the area and it’s typical because one fighter is being defensive while backing away from the aggressive fighter.

Examples:

Anakin vs Obi Wan Kenobi 

Jack Reacher vs Paulie 

John wick vs Cassian (first fight) 

Sonic vs Shadow (last fight) 

Peter vs the chicken (almost all their fights lol)

These fight scenes I actually like because they start from essentially a flat surface than towards the end they aren’t at the same area compared to the beginning of the fight.

Does anyone know what type of fight scenes these are called?

movies,1luip12,"Please recommend a ""Once in a Year"" best movie from 2019-2024","Hello!

I'm currently looking for movie recommendations. Specifically, I'm interested in some of the very best movies released each year between 2019 and 2024. If you have any personal favourites or films that are critically acclaimed, I’d really appreciate your suggestions.

To give you a better idea of my taste, here are a few films I’ve watched recently that I absolutely loved!

* Dune: Part One
* Dune: Part Two
* Godzilla Minus One
* Parasite
* Oppenheimer

These films stood out to me not only because of their compelling stories, but also due to their exceptional cinematography, immersive world-building, powerful storytelling, and beautiful colour grading. Mainly the colour grading. I really love movies that are visually stunning, and emotionally driven. Bonus if it's scifi, I am not too interested in ""grounded"" type films, I find Oppenheimer to be an exception due to the larger than life scale of the nature of the film.

I’m looking to create watchlist of films that represents the pinnacle of cinema for each year. So if there are movies that you feel were  standout films from 2019 through to 2024, I’d love to hear about them.

I may have come in with way too high expectations, but it really just felt like an ok movie, nothing special.

Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is one of the best I have EVER seen in any movie, but the actual story? Many plot points felt rushed, like Mia literally cheated on her boyfriend for some bum she met a week ago just cuz she heard him play piano well. That whole sequence felt so weird, and I genuinely thought I missed an hour of the movie, cuz how are they just gonna move past all that so fast?

The characters didn't have much built up either, all their development revolved around their jobs and not really about them as people or their relationship.

After that beginning sequence, and we start time skipping, the story makes more sense and is alright, but still feels like a very basic romance (starts with puppy love, climaxes at some major conflict, then resolves).

Our first day winner, from Afghanistan, is **Osama (2004) directed by Siddiq Barmak.** This was one of the first movies made entirely in and about Afghanistan directly after the Taliban lost control in 2001. Sadly, the Taliban being in control again means the outright ban on movies, music, and anything secular. Hopefully someday we will get more emotionally arresting films like this. If you want to watch it without pirating, this is available on Amazon Prime Video and has English subtitles.

I hadn't heard of Osama or a few others mentioned and that is my hope for everyone interested in following along with this project. To find non mainstream movies from different cultures with different languages.

Okay let's do **Bahrain.**

The rules (i added II and III today for clarifications):

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

movies,1lu8bkm,"July 4-6 Box Office Recap – 'Jurassic World Rebirth' opens with a fantastic $147.8M domestically and $322.6M worldwide on its first five days. Meanwhile, 'F1' reaches almost $300M worldwide and becomes Apple's biggest film at the box office.","https://preview.redd.it/gaqv8rk75jbf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d006313609133fa978537c52a8d1d185b3009d57

It was a weekend for fireworks and dinosaurs.

***Jurassic World Rebirth*** opened with a monster $322 million worldwide, showing there's still power in this franchise after 30 years. And while ***F1*** took a rough drop in the domestic market, it's still a hit overseas, as the film is nearing $300 million worldwide and officially became Apple's highest grossing film ever.

The Top 10 earned a combined $152 million this weekend. That's 0.2% up from last year, when ***Despicable Me 4*** debuted atop.

Debuting at #1, ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** debuted with $92 million in 4,308 theaters. Adding in its numbers from Wednesday and Thurday, the film earned an incredible $147.8 million. This is hard to compare with the previous ***Jurassic World*** films, as all films opened on Friday. So just for reference; ***Fallen Kingdom*** earned $148 million on its first 3 days, and ***Dominion*** made $145 million.

What does this debut suggest? What everyone always knew: people love dinosaurs. And that has always been the franchise's biggest advantage. There are no other dino franchises currently, which has allowed Universal to cater to an audience that wants to see these monsters in the big screen. There's a lot of franchises that have experienced fatigue, but the ***Jurassic*** clearly is still beloved 32 years later after its debut in theaters.

The film had a very rushed production; it was officially announced in January 2024, although a script was written for quite some time. Gareth Edwards was hired one month later, when the current release date was already set. So basically the film was reported, filmed and released in the span of just 18 months. That's very short for a blockbuster. But then again, audiences don't pay much attention to productions. What they care for is if the film looks interesting or catches their interest, and Universal achieved it. They sold it as a ""back to basics"" film, choosing to just abandon all characters from the prior films and focus on new characters, played by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey. Turns it out all worked out.

According to Universal, 61% of the audience was male. The films are popular with families, although ***Rebirth*** starts to point that it's losing some young audience members. Only 36% of the audience was 25 and under, which is below ***Fallen Kingdom*** (56%) and ***Dominion*** (41%). At the end of the day, that's pretty much imminent when your franchise is 30 years old.

So yes, everything worked out in the end. Well, almost everything. What did ***Rebirth*** fail at? Reception. Critics were unimpressed with the film, giving it a mediocre 52% on RT. Somehow, that was an improvement over the past two films, but that's still not a good score. Regardless, the debut suggests the audience was still excited to watch the film. But the film's word of mouth indicates that this will play very, very differently, and that's another thing were ***Rebirth*** failed.

Audiences gave ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** a very weak ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is very poor for a blockbuster. That's worse than any of the ***Jurassic World*** films, and it's the second lowest in the franchise, just above ***Jurassic Park III*** (""B–""). This is an indication that audiences are not content with the film. It's hard to point to a domestic total prediction given that this is a 5-day debut, but with high competition like ***Superman*** and ***The Fantastic Four: First Steps*** arriving, it's very likely the film will continue the franchise's decline at the box office. Definitely a success, but it's gonna put a lot of pressure on the next film.

Last week's champ ***F1*** added $25.7 million this weekend. That's a rough 55% drop from last week, but when you have a juggernaut like ***Jurassic World***, a drop like that is pretty much imminent. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $109.2 million domestically, the first Apple title to hit that milestone. There's still heavy competition on its way, but ***F1*** should still have enough gas left to hit $160 million domestically.

In third place, ***How to Train Your Dragon*** dipped 43%, adding $11.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $224.2 million, finally becoming the franchise's biggest film in the domestic market.

There doesn't appear to be any signs of life in Disney/Pixar's ***Elio***. It dropped 45% and made just $5.7 million. That drop is barely better than last week, indicating word of mouth isn't really doing anything to save the film. The film has made an abysmal $55 million so far, and it's going to struggle to hit $65 million at this rate.

***28 Years Later*** remained at #5, although it still dropped 53% and added $4.5 million this weekend. At least that's better than last week's steep 67% drop, but it's still rough. The film has already earned $60.2 million, and it should finish with around $67 million domestically.

***M3GAN 2.0*** continued disappointing on its second weekend. The film collapsed a poor 61%, earning just $3.9 million this weekend. That's far worse than the original's second weekend drop (a very light 39.8%). The sequel has earned a very poor $18.7 million, which is a colossal 68% behind the original through the same point. With more competition on its way, it's highly likely the film will finish with less than $25 million domestically.

***Lilo & Stitch*** dropped 45% and earned $3.8 million. The film has amassed $408.5 million so far.

In eighth place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** eased just 34% and added $2.7 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $191.1 million, and it will soon pass ***Rogue Nation*** ($195 million) to become the fourth biggest film in the franchise.

***Materialists*** had another rough drop this weekend. This time, it dropped 55% and added $1.3 million. That took its total to $33.5 million.

Rounding out the Top 10 was the 41st anniversary re-release of ***This Is Spinal Tap***. It earned $1 million from 1,015 theaters, taking its lifetime gross to $5.7 million. Man, it should've made $1.1 million, come on.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Jurassic World Rebirth*** debuted with $174 million overseas, for a monster $322.6 million worldwide debut. China was its biggest debut with $41.5 million, which is the biggest for a Hollywood title this year. However, it should be noted that the film was quite front-loaded in the market amidst poor word of mouth. Other strong debuts were seen in the UK ($16.6M), Mexico ($13.9M), Germany ($7.6M), South Korea ($7.4M), Spain ($6.5M), Australia ($5.9M), India ($5.5M/best of franchise), France ($5.3M) and Italy ($4.7M).

All the ***Jurassic World*** films have cracked $1 billion, but don't expect the same to happen to ***Rebirth***. Not only was it lower than ***Dominion*** $392 million worldwide debut, but most of these debuts were all from 5-day debuts, which is boosting its numbers. For now, a $800 million worldwide total is likely. Another success in the franchise, but it will continue marking another decline.

***F1*** was impacted domestically, but it continues killing it overseas. Despite the arrival of ***Rebirth***, the film dipped just 38% and added $56.3 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $293 million. It's already Apple's biggest film worldwide. In China, the film had an insane 2% second weekend drop, which is the best for a Hollywood title this year, and now the film is set to massively over-perform in the market. The best markets are China ($22M), the UK ($17.3M), Mexico ($12.3M), France ($11.5M) and Australia ($9.8M). Assuming it keeps holding very well, the film should definitely pass $450 million worldwide.

***How to Train Your Dragon*** added $21 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $519 million. The best markets are China ($35.5M), Mexico ($33.4M), the UK ($24.6M), Brazil ($17.2M) and France ($14.2M). It has already passed the original film's worldwide gross, and by tomorrow it will pass ***The Hidden World*** ($520 million).

***28 Years Later*** added $7 million overseas, allowing it to cross $125 million worldwide. The UK has been its biggest market, unsurprisingly, earning $17 million so far. The film should finish with around $140 million worldwide.

Continuing its absolutely pathetic run in pretty much every territory, Disney/Pixar's ***Elio*** made $6.7 overseas, taking its worldwide total to just $97.7 million worldwide. The best markets are France ($4.7M), the UK ($4.1M), South Korea ($3.6M), China ($3.5M) and Mexico ($2.8M). 3 weeks in and a Pixar title still hasn't cracked $100 million worldwide. What a time to be alive.

***Lilo & Stitch*** added $6.1 overseas, taking its worldwide total to $972 million. That allowed it to finally pass ***A Minecraft Movie*** as the year's second highest grossing film, just behind ***Ne Zha 2***. The best markets are Mexico ($66.5M), the UK ($48.3M), France ($40.5M), Brazil ($36.5M) and Germany ($30.8M).

With $3.9 million overseas, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** has officially passed ***Dead Reckoning*** worldwide with a $576.1 million total, becoming the fourth biggest film in the franchise.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*A Minecraft Movie* | Apr/4 | Warner Bros. | $162,753,003 | $423,949,195 | $954,928,702 | $150M

- *A Minecraft Movie* has closed its run with a fantastic $954 million worldwide. Considering the insanely negative response to its first teaser, it's still a sign of the brand's strength that it could make almost $1 billion. Of course, the film's legs were very mediocre (2.60x is not great at all for family films, given those easily pass 3x), which is a sign that they weren't fully satisfied by the film itself. Whenever the sequel comes up, they must deliver something better than this, quality-wise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

A new era of DC begins this weekend.

That's because it's the arrival of DC's ***Superman***, the first film in the new DC Universe (DCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it stars David Corensweet as the Man of Steel, and it follows Superman's journey to reconcile his alien heritage with his adoptive human family. To say that expectations are high for this film is selling it short. As previously mentioned, this is gonna kick off a new DC Universe, after the DCEU had the insane distinction of having 8 box office flops in a row. And that's not even including the absolute misfire of ***Joker: Folie à Deux***. Needless to say, the brand is at an all-time low and ***Superman*** will need to win over people. With a high $225 million budget and an extensive marketing campaign, this film really needs to be a home run for the sake of DC.

movies,1lu75vo,Is Directing more technical than creative?,"So I read the first few pages of the script of Lady Bird. I began picturing the opening scene like I would while reading a novel. The script didn't say it out loud but clearly the mother and daughter were talking fast, emotionally charged.

Upon seeing the actual opening scene, it was almost the same except the very first shot. Rest all were very similar to what I imagined.

This got me thinking, is directing really a creative task or more of a technical one. Is directing more about managing the crew to ""pull it off"" than being creative? Because I had heard that the script is just ""bare bones"", not as descriptive as a novel, hence the director has to give life to it by adding an emotional backdrop. But this feels strange because the script may not say the feeling out loud but it is quite obvious like the opening of Lady Bird.

For example the script didn't say that they were talking over each other fast, but it was very obvious.

I know the basic story is Emma Stone's character, Bella, being a child in the body of a grown woman. What I find weird is her sexual liberation, which okay... but like she's a child? Also the fact that she's having sex with a bunch of men. How is that empowering? The whole movie to me just seemed like men taking advantage (sexually) of a child. I don't really see how this is supposed to be feminist and ""freeing.""  I don't know, the whole film just seemed very pornographic and sad to me. I don't understand how this is being praised for its story. And I don't think anyone who disagrees with this film is a ""mysoginistic man.""

I will give it to them though, the cinematography, costumes, and performances are great. Other than that I think it's a weird film, and not in a good way. 

These are,  obviously, just my thoughts though. Someone help me understand the whole feminist view point.

Did you eventually see the film?

I've got a few of 'em.

DRAGONSLAYER: I was 11 years old and a friend's mom took us.  The film is surprisingly rather brutal, and when we got to the scene where the baby dragons are eating the princess, she noped out of the film and we all had to leave.  I ended up seeing it a few weeks later when the film hit a second run theater (my brother took me).  Great movie.

JOES VS THE VOLCANO: My girlfriend at the time was hating it so we left shortly after Tom Hanks got onto the yacht.  She offered me positive inducement to leave so we did so.  I eventually saw it when it hit VHS and a few times since.  It's OK.

SPIDER-MAN: I was liking the film but something didn't agree with me from the meal I had prior to sitting down.  What I thought would be a quick bathroom break ended up running until the film ended.  I was loving the film up until the point that I left so I went and saw it the following weekend.  My wife, who was with me for the aborted viewing, loved the film and saw it again with me.  Great movie.  I know that critical consensus holds that the sequel is the best of the trilogy but I prefer that first one still.

About the plot, I was feeling confused that the bf didn't seem to know that she was a robot.   
I supposed that maybe he'd realize and reject her and she'd snap and go on a killing spree.  
I was pleased when it went in a rather different direction. I mean, from a moral point of view the whole thing of fake memories/identity is a huge no go (let alone being considered an object).  
But it was cool that actually she was the only normal person there.

When she raised her intelligence to 100% my expectations also went up.  
And when she kept acting rather silly it didn't feel right, it felt like if the writers were nerfing her for plot contrivance.  
Although this silliness did give room for that hilarious scene when she talks in German with the cop, unable to lie but he couldn't understand what she was saying,

But when she was captured, and all what happened afterwards, it didn't feel quite right anymore.  
Also the ""domestic abuse"" scenes with candle etc, it felt unnecessary, and it wasn't where I wished the movie to go.  
The male robot' suicide felt wrong too.  
And the finale felt rushed and not on spot, like if the plot had missed a chance for much more. Which is what I feel in general for the whole last third of the movie.

Plus, quite a few plot holes.  
\- Dude has the ability to mod such an advanced android and plans a murder and he doesn't even read the terms of use? Even without video recordings it's clear that the the manufacturer has a way to see if the product was tampered with.   
\- She has only wifi and visual stuff in the head, and yet she shuts off with a shot?  
Then she wakes up and she can still see and function perfectly?  
\- The dude of the robots company could give her complete freedom? What company would be so crazy to build androids which can be freed of every restriction with just a quick change of settings?  
And if he can do that much, how does he not have a vocal code to shut down Patrick when he was attacking him?  
\- Also, her running away like if she now has freedom, really?  
The company won't even investigate why she's missing? She doesn't have a GPS chip?  
Ex Machina does the ""getting freedom"" thing MUCH better.

movies,1ltwldr,The Legend of Bagger Vance is  brilliant,"You may have stumbled upon The Legend of Bagger Vance on the golf channel and thought “interesting concept to use golf as an analogy for life”. The movie makes some bad cinematic choices at times, and many of the plot points are unnecessary or don’t add much to the whole of thr movie. What makes this movie so brilliant in my opinion? It’s that the movie is based on the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita, in which Krishna tutors the warrior-hero Arjuna. 

It’s not easy to articulate what Brahman is according to Hinduism, or how one can attain experimental knowledge of it. In fact, intellectual understanding of Brahman is basically pointless, as it’s “not something that can be taught or learned, only remembered” as stated in Bagger Vance.

There are several key quotes that do an amazing job at hinting towards the truth of Brahman without being overly explanatory, and in fact the at times vague references to it promote inquiry on the viewer in the same way an actual guru would want to a illicit. Perhaps the best example of this is when Bagger Vance is talking to one of the tournament organizers about why Junuh hasn’t been playing well, and says it’s because “he still thinks he’s Rannulph Junuh”, to which the organizer says “he is Rannulph Junuh though!” and Bagger says “well…he is and he isn’t”. This is reffering to the idea that our ego and sense of separation from the whole of reality is an illusion, and that our true identity is Atman, our soul that is identical to Brahman.

Nearly every scene with Bagger Vance throughout the movie is layered with nods to Brahman, but in a way where you could watch the whole film and have no idea it’s alluding to Hinduism if you’re not aware of the philosophy, and I think that makes it one of the most special movies of all time.

movies,1ltqnp6,2001: A Space Odyssey,"I was loving the beginning of the movie and I can appreciate very much the production quality, the cinematography, the music and even the unrealistic sci-fi aspects! But if I wanted to experience what it feels like to be stuck in limbo for about 2 hours and then be tripping on psychedelics for about the last 10 minutes, I would spend my money on drugs instead! The entire film just feels like very very slow moving exposition which leads up to nothing meaningful. Open-ended is one thing, and I know that a well told story doesn't need to have resolution, but I seriously feel like I've had my time wasted even with the redeeming qualities! Even if everything about the obelisks/artifacts and the aliens was completely left unresolved, I would have appreciated a little bit more fast-paced and detailed world building, which would at least leave you intrigued or get you invested in this world. No means of propulsion visible or explained for any of the ships, no explanation as to how we got multi-story lunar bases and giant spinning space stations within 33 years of 1968, are those giant hangers pressurized at all (if not then what's the point of colossal closing gates which would be wildly inconvenient to build and if they are air locks then how do you pressurize such a vast space), how come they have a lunar city completed yet the space station is still under construction??? Okay fine you don't have to cover every single technological development if you're just focusing on the story but where is the progression? Proto-humans learn to wield sticks by touching an artifact, we have a giant rotating space station in 2001, lunar travel is routine and there's a city on the moon, they find the same artifact on the moon, it transmits something, they send a mission to Jupiter, AI dooms the mission, and the remaining astronaut finds a rectangle, has an acid trip, turns into giant fetus? Most of the time is spent showing off big machines with Strauss playing in the back. ""A trip to the moon"" had a longer story and the entire film is silent and less than 15 minutes long!

I mean am I missing something here?

The cinematography was phenomenal, the sound design was immaculate, the world building was almost okay, the storytelling and pacing leave much to be desired!

movies,1ltr36w,2001: A Space Odyssey - How Educated was the Audience?,"I'm by no means an engineer, let alone an expert on space, but I know a bit about physics - enough to understand Newton's laws. Enough to understand that an object flying through space on its way to Jupiter won't just wait for you if you leave it for a spacewalk and apply force to propel yourself in a different direction. If you want to return to the spaceship afterwards, you'll need to shoot yourself back in its direction and catch up. But in 2001: A Space Odyssey there are scenes in which the spaceship is treated as stationary, allowing the crew to meander about outside and then just return whenever they feel like it.

I understand that it's just a film, and there have been worse cases of botched space science (I'm lookihg at you Star Wars), but this especially surprised me because of the film's release date - wasn't 1968 the height of the space race? Weren't viewers more knowledgeable about how objects behave in space? 

Funnily enough, one of the film's main themes is that 'man is a baby in space,' so yes, you can expect the audience to not fully understand these things. But I don't think this was a deliberate mistake carried out to make a point, but rather an ironic proof of the concept, showing that even the filmmakers didn't understand the subject. 

I haven't seen anybody point this out. Was this discussed at all when the movie was released?

Edit: some of you are commenting about retaining the ship's velocity. Yes, of course you would retain its velocity, but I've specifically mentioned that the crew applied force to *propel itself away from the ship* and then didn't need to catch up to it.

movies,1ltmf6a,I think I finally understand No Country for Old Men for myself,"I've always loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters, but I think I've always struggled to connect with it thematically. Obviously the movie is subject to a wide variety of interpretation, but I saw it again last night and there were a couple of scenes that stood out to me this time:

1. The conversation Sheriff Ed Bell has with his brother. His brother brings up the point about having humility and warns Ed not to believe the world *works differently for you*.

2. The scene where Carson Welles meets Lleweyln Moss in the hospital in Mexico. Carson is talking about Chigurh, and Llewelyn makes the comments ""Who is this guy? The ultimate badass?"" in kind of an annoyed tone of voice.

The three main protagonists of the movie, Llewelyn, Ed Bell, and Chigurh, all share the same flaw to varying degrees--they all share in a degree of personal exceptionalism:

1. Ed Bell believes at some level that he's on a noble path, and like he tells his brother, he felt like his choices would be validated in the end by ""God suddenly coming into my life""--feeling like his life would culminate in some spiritual satisfaction and was therefore meant to be. He has become disillusioned by the lack of this feeling--a lack of success or victory as a lawman (as he sees it), with the criminals getting away with heinous, senseless violence. He can't even find closure in his personal life--the dream he describes to his wife in the end symbolizes that: it doesn't have a happy, meaningful ending--it just ends.

2. Llewlyn thinks *he* is the ultimate badass and that he's smart/tough enough to overcome any adversary, even if it's the full brunt of the drug cartel. He tries to act like he's Rambo by putting all of his Vietnam combat experience into staging his escape/cat-and-mouse hunt with Chigurh, and his ego won't let him give up the fight. Carla Jean is enamored by this quality when she tries to tell Ed Bell that Llewelyn can take on all comers. In actuality, we see, as Carson points out, that he's a loser who can't make ends meet and is really not that difficult to predict. The movie devotes a fair number of scenes to him ""prepping"" for the fight by buying various things from sporting goods stores, and as a moviegoer you expect some kind of Rambo/A-Team/MacGyver-esque ingenuity from that, but it doesn't really amount to much. His skills and instincts keep him alive for a while, but he never really turns the tables and is vastly outnumbered by the cartel, which has no dearth of hitmen after him.

3. Chigurh, of course, is delusional and insane and believes he is some sort of supernatural force of fate.

All three guys commit the sin of vanity in their own ways, and Reality ensues for them all, but the only one to cash his chips in and move on with life is Bell. He is humbled by the carnage and literally escapes with his life after he decides to give up his pursuit (with Chigurh right there!). That's the movie for me--it's an all-time great movie that still has me thinking about it nearly twenty years later.",819,142,1751867475.0,Discussion,0.9,True,False,wordsandwich,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ltmf6a/i_think_i_finally_understand_no_country_for_old/,new,medium
movies,1ltly43,"The ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl Trope"" is NOT sexist and wildly overhated.","I know. I am a straight white man and I do not understand the experiences and nuance of being woman no matter how progressive and empathetic I try to appear for others who have faced discrimination. BUT as someone who has recently come across this idea of the MPDG in media, I find this critique of relationship to be incredibly overblown.

For those who do not know, a MPDG is a trope in media where a woman, usually eccentric and wild, enters some sort of relationship with a man who defies the conventional ""alpha male"" trope that is usually depicted in romances. Some of the most popular examples are Summer (500 Days of Summer) and Sam (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and Ramona (Scott Pilgrim).

My issue with the argument that it is sexist comes from 2 very important points:

1. Media exists in a different frame than reality. The entire point of media is to fulfill the imagination of our minds that stray away from reality. We do not watch television for the mundane expected things in our lives, but for things that shock us or provide some sort of stimulation (fear, anger, horniness, heartache). The unrealistic love interests extend to all different types of characters and so if the story is about one specific character and another is used as a prop to explore their arc and the way they interact in the world... than it honestly is not that big of a deal.

2. The Double-Standard between genders. As someone who watches a lot of KDramas, one of the biggest tropes I see if the hot, rich, ripped businessman with all good values be used as a way to bring out the ""country poor girl"" out of her shell and introduce her into the world. No one bats an eye and points out how offensive it is for an entire man's pirpose is to explore the archetype of the woman. It is the same thing. And I do not care because I know it to be media. Those ""perfect men"" do not exist in the real world... just as the MPDGs do not. It is all in the head of the person who is at the center of the film.

But what do you think? Am I actually being sexist and just not cognizant of it? Or does my opinion hold some merit?",0,79,1751865742.0,Media,0.19,True,False,Over-Heron-2654,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ltly43/the_manic_pixie_dream_girl_trope_is_not_sexist/,new,low

movies,1lth6fa,RRR (2022),"RRR is a 2022 Telugu-language Indian movie that’s over three hours long. It's a period, action, drama, comedy, musical, epic story. 

The story follows two men, Raju and Bheem. They are in 1920s India during the British Empire’s rule. Raju is an undercover cop, he is performing an investigation to find a man. He doesn’t know what this man looks like, all he knows is that he will be in hiding, not using his real name; in a sense, the man whom he is looking for will also be undercover. 

While performing this search, Raju meets Bheem and they become best friends. Well, it turns out that Bheem is the person that Raju is looking for, but during their friendship, he doesn’t realize it. It’s as if in The Departed, the Matt and Leo characters became best friends. The story continues from there, and gets even wilder.

If you haven’t seen this film, go watch it. It is a thrill ride to say the least. The action is over the top in the best possible way. The story of friendship between Raju and Bheem is one of the best bromances ever put to screen. The way they meet is one of the craziest action set pieces I’ve ever seen. It involves one riding a horse, the other riding a motorcycle, both jumping off a bridge, and there’s  an exploding train. The music is fantastic. At one point, while our characters are at a somewhat snobby English party, there is a dance-off that is quite ridiculous, but by that point in the film, you are so into the story that it doesn’t matter. It’s not the sort of thing most American audiences would get into, but trust me, you should let yourself experience it.

Now I’m going to spoil some of the film. There are some twists/reveals that happen, and I want to be able to discuss some aspects of the film that will give them away, so if you haven’t seen RRR, stop reading here if you don’t want the story spoiled.

What I want to get into first is Raju and what his real background is. The idea up until the reveal is that this whole time, he has just been an undercover cop. This works as a story, but, even as handsome and charming as Raju is, the character is a terrible person. He is Indian, but all we have seen from him is an extreme desire to be a good soldier for the British Empire and do whatever he must in order to gain promotion within the military ranks. Once we finally get to the flashback scene where we see Raju as a child, we see that has actually gone undercover as a civilian while being a civilian who is undercover as a cop - yeah, I know, hard to do the mental gymnastics, but trust me, in the movie, it’s quite clear. Now, after we get to know his true story, I don’t hate him so much. His whole goal has been to bring guns to his people so that they could have a better chance of fighting back the British. But, I still don’t like what he’s done in order to achieve his goal. He has hurt his own people in order to help the greater Indian population.

The choice to show this flashback before the scene where Raju publicly whips Bheem makes that flogging even more powerful. Raju is whipping his best friend, and a friend he is actually on the same side as, but he still can’t let the British know that. Bheem refuses to neel, and through the power of music, turns the public whipping from a tactic of the British to control through fear, into a way of rallying the Indian people together against the oppressive English government. Meanwhile, Raju has to do so much evil to the ones he sides with in order to achieve his goals. At this point I’m also reminded of the man he tortures whilst looking for Bheem, as well as all the people he hurt in his introduction scene where he fights an entire mob.

Luckily, we have another character to compare with Raju. Bheem’s goal is much simpler. All he wants is to rescue his little sister, Malli, from the English woman who kidnapped her. Once Bheem finds Malli, he only hurts people on the enemy side. He never hurts anyone on the same side as him. Once he learns Raju’s truth, he goes to rescue his friend. The action of the rescue is goofy as hell, but fantastic all the same. 

Actually, that sums up much of the movie, “goofy as hell, but fantastic all the same.” It’s fantastic in how over the top the action is.  There is literally a dance-off. One character breaks into song while being whipped in public. The love between Bheem and Raju is genuine. The way the actor’s use their expressive eyes is top work. Like most Americans, I’m usually a little bit averse to watching foreign movies, but trust me, RRR is worth it.",0,7,1751850173.0,Review,0.39,True,False,antantantantantant,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lth6fa/rrr_2022/,new,low

I am going to FINISH the rest of the world. All of North America, all of South America, all of Asia, all of Oceania, and all of Africa. Some of these countries will be tough to get answers for but we will do our best. Just like u/Impossible_Werewolf I will be operating this alphabetically per continent. I will be including a select few landmasses that are widely recognized as separate countries depending on which government you ask. This includes but not limited to: Taiwan, Palestine, Western Sahara, and Greenland. However, to make things easier, I won't be including all existing territories, especially little island ones.

 The order of continents will be:

1. Asia

2. Oceania

3. Africa

4. South America

5. North America

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Though let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted. 

II) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. **Please! I don’t wanna go through reading a bunch of the same movie.**

movies,1ltgnjg,Most distracting use of sound effects you've ever heard in a movie?,"I used to do SFX and my first job out of university was a shock to me because I realized motorbikes and gunshots on screen didn't sound like actual motorbikes or gunshots. I suddenly realized the studio's collection of 100 000 sound effects was useless without the experience to know which 50 effects the audience had been conditioned to accept as authentic by other films. And then there as the foleying that I helped with, in which a man kneeing a watermelon doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, a real punch to the face doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, but a man kneeing a watermelon with olive oil on his leg sounded ""right"" for reasons I can't explain.

Something I appreciate in the filming of movies is when the actors are actually shouting in loud environments (nightclubs, windstorms) because they're recorded in silence and the music/wind is added later. What this usually results in is the audio being loud to establish it's loud, then the SFX editor has to radically drop the levels because the actors have been recorded talking in their normal voices. I appreciate it when the director gives them directions to act like they're in a loud place. I was on a set once where the director had the actors put earplugs in so they HAD to yell (everyone in the scene had long hair or were given weird hats to hide the ear plugs).

Anyways, I'm watching Bullet Train Explosion right now and they just used the Wilhelm scream for a student getting punched. I had to burst out laughing because, well, it sounds right when someone falls off a cliff, not when someone falls over a train seat.

movies,1ltgkw2,"With all the superhero & tentpoles films regularly costing $200+ million, we should be in a new golden age of action cinema. Yet it feels like the opposite is true. Since Mad Max Fury Road, Big budget filmmaking seems to have hit an action plateau.","Look at the Mission Impossible franchise. 400 million for the lastest film yet not a single sequence comes close to matching the franchises action apex. The first films train Chunnel sequence or the Burj Khalifa climb in MI4. 


I hate to turn this into a “back in the day” thing but when cgi was advancing year after year in the early 90s-2010s it really felt like action cinema has being topped every couple years along with it. Studios would pour millions into R&D to create a sequence or sequences such as Spiderman fighting Doc Ock or Neo fighting dozens of Agent Smiths or Anakin Skywalker Podracing, twisters demolishing a town or LOTR with Aargorn defending helms deep, the Rohirrim charge & Mines of Moria. These sequences would be planned and detailed so that visual effects companies knew what could or couldn’t be done with the tech available.

It was as if break thrus were created just to have these sorts of sequences. And I’m not saying action sucks today’s or it’s bad. No. It just seems like there isn’t that focused “set piece” style of filmmaking. Like the car chase in Matrix Reloaded. Or Davey Jones sending the Kraken after Jack Sparrow. Or T-Rex terrorizing a couple kids and eating a lawyer.

Audiences were seeing things we had never seen before. Transformers fighting in a city? Awesome. But over time? Superhero’s battling gets stale. Thousands of computer generated armies clashing gets stale.

Requiem for a Dream, 12 Years a Slave, Grave of the Fireflies, Dear Zachary - all these movies are really well made and people give them their flowers, but like no shit people only want to watch them once, they're emotionally devastating. 
  
Meanwhile I think of Nomadland. Other than the main character's background of losing her things in a recession, the story isn't supposed to be sad. I mean, it's about a woman finding out what makes her happy and brings her joy and peace. And she finds a community of like-minded people. But man, it just instilled such an incredible sense of loneliness in me unlike anything else I've seen.

But then, the success of Shrek proved that it's acceptable for movies marketed towards kids to have swearing & sex jokes to appeal to older audiences, and therfore obtain a PG rating.

There are several movies from the 70s & 80s that were rated PG but would be PG-13 now. Several examples include Jaws, Star Wars, Airplane, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beetlejuice, Gremlins, etc. In fact the PG-13 rating was created because the MPAA didn't know where to place Temple of Doom. The downside is that gory movies like these is all that Hollywood wanted to make for years.

But then PG movie is now try to be as inoffensive, safe, and sanitized as possible. The give every kids' movie this rating despite not doing anything to justify it. For instance, would parents even bother watching movies like Despicable Me, Frozen, Trolls, or Encanto with their kids? Not really.

But we're entering the era where PG movies are starting to take risks & actually earn there ratings. A few examples on the live action front are Conclave, Wicked, and the Sonic movies. And there are many PG-rated animated movies that I can name that justify their ratings as well (both old & new):

movies,1ltepi5,Bad/mediocre movies with great performances hidden in them?,"Movies that were absolute, total stinkers, or even painfully average, but had great performances they didn’t deserve. 

One that comes to mind is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. These movies have a lot of problems, even though I enjoy them, but Ewan McGregor’s performance is the one of the things that is consistently good through all 3 movies. He brings a level of emotional depth and nuance to the character the script and direction doesn’t even call for. It’s a testament to how poor the direction is when there are so many other great actors who give awful, wooden performances in those films. Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid all rise above the shitty script and direction as well, bringing life to their characters and chewing the scenery. 

Another film is X Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman gave his best performance as the title character up to that point, and it was completely wasted on the steaming pile of dogshit that was that movie. Liev Schreiber was also excellent in that film, bringing a charisma to Sabretooth that a less skilled actor would have lacked. 

Michael Fassbender in Prometheus comes to mind as well

What are some other examples?

movies,1ltbwkz,"I  hadn't heard of ""Riff Raff"" until I saw it advertised on Hulu. Do yourself a favor and watch it tonight if you haven't already.","It's not the best crime film ever made by any stretch, and parts are a little bit predictable, but the cast is stellar and there are a few fun surprises.

Notably, Pete Davidson is pretty fucking great in his role. Normally when one sees Davidson in a film, he's playing a version of himself, but not in *Riff Raff*. Instead he plays the role a little quieter (comparatively) and more seriously, even though the character is kind of stupid. It makes for a great turn for the guy.

Bill Murray plays a total asshole, but this is the first time I've seen Murray really try acting in awhile, and he pulls it off. He doesn't even steal all of the scenes he's in for a change.

Gabrielle Union is great as always, but I do wish her character had been given more to do than be the concerned-and-then-worried wife.

Ed Harris is getting grizzled, and it's in a good way. Here he is a former gangster whose past is catching up to him, and he's just over it. And it's great.

Then there is the great Jennifer Coolidge who is having a renaissance of sorts. I am convinced there is nobody in Hollywood having more fun than her right now and it's great to see. 

And rounding things out is Lewis Pullman, son of Bill, who will also be starring in the new *Spaceballs* film because he has the exact same manner of charm as his dad, and it's great to see.

The film itself is a tad formulaic as far as this kind of film goes, sure. But the acting from everyone is great, and there are some really well-out-together scenes, notably the sequence in which Murray and Davidson's characters go to Vincent's house in search of him to kill him and his son (Pullman) only to be greeted by neighbors who bring them cookies.

The ending ends like four times, which hearkens back to the post-Pulp Fiction crime film explosion of the mid-90s, but it can be forgiven.

movies,1ltbkbb,It feels like very few animated movies nowadays actually feel like they earned the PG rating,"Remember that the original meaning of the PG rating means Parent Guidance and before PG-13 was introduced that's what a lot of movies fall into and nowadays the PG rating feels like a replacement for the G rating even though that its original intended meaning mint some things were in there for older audiences

And many animated movies nowadays feel like they absolutely do not deserve the PG rating and should be rated G instead

and remember the PG rating does not mean kid friendly and in a lot of older PG movies there was a lot of stuff that aren't going to be suitable for kids nowadays

and though there were still some exceptions like Hunchback of Notre Dame being rated G despite having a song where the main villain sings about his lust and hellfire for a woman and blaming him for him sining but that just so happens to be the exception not the rule

and very few animated movies from the past 25 years actually felt that they deserved the PG rating

and also there are some movies that absolutely do not deserve the PG rating at all like the second Paw Patrol movie being the same age rating as Watership Down is definitely wrong like WTF!?

And most modern Disney and Pixar movies don't feel like they've earned its PG rating at all especially Frozen and the first zootopia movie

I remember when PG movies actually require ""parent guidance"" instead of being G-rated movies pretending to be PG

and also a lot of DreamWorks movies actually deserve their PG rating but there are still some I feel like don't deserve it like the trolls franchise and every single one of illuminations movies don't deserve that PG rating at all and should be rated G

over the past 25 years there are very few animated movies that actually earned its PG rating actually requiring parent guidance instead of it being a G-rated movie in disguise

but it seems like we're now entering the era of PG movies that actually earned their rating

we're starting to see more and more PG movies actually pushing the boundaries and actually acquiring parents guidance like the old PG movies before the PG-13 rating was introduced

Like Conclave and Wicked being successes

and it seems like animated movies are starting to go in this direction as well

and we're going to see more animated movies head in this direction as well

like we already saw with Transformers One has a lot of violence non mild swearing like ""Hell"" and ""Ass"" and it's deep political messages that might not be suitable for young audiences so it would actually require ""parent guidance"" and thus Transformers One is much closer to PG movies back then actually getting away with a lot more stuff than PG movies now

and the Spider Verse films are much closer to older PG movies and tones then than modern ones

and it seems like from what I heard from the rumors, zootopia 2 is going to be a lot darker and more mature than the previous film, with the main villain actually murdering several characters

and here are some other PG animated movies that earned their rating

-Kpop Demon Hunters

-Coraline

-The Mitchells vs. the Machines

-Wreck-It Ralph

-Kubo and the Two Strings

-Shrek

-The Incredibles

-The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists

and it seems good that we're going into the direction where PG films do not always mean kid-friendly being G-rated films in disguise

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.

technology,7779es,The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. This could be the last chance for Internet users to make their voices heard.,"Hey reddit, I wanted to give everyone a heads up that Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. 

**There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW. It's a long shot, but it's our best shot. Please spread the word, and message me if you want to learn more or get involved.

technology,6e8wta,Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)
* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)
* Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321)
* Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)  (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253)
* Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031)
* Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)  (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006)
* Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA)  (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211)
* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

technology,867jo1,The CLOUD Act would let cops get our data directly from big tech companies like Facebook without needing a warrant. Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.,"Congress just attached the CLOUD Act to the 2,232 page, must-pass [omnibus package](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf). It's on page 2,201.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions.

Major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oath are [supporting](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2018/02/Tech-Companies-Letter-of-Support-for-Senate-CLOUD-Act-020618.pdf) the bill because it makes their lives easier by relinquishing their responsibility to protect their users’ data from cops. And they’ve been throwing their lobby power behind getting the CLOUD Act attached to the omnibus government spending bill. 

Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act).

There's certainly MANY other bad things in this omnibus package. But don't lose sight of this one. Passing the CLOUD Act would impact all of our privacy and would have serious implications.

technology,fkzfzq,Reject the anti-encryption bill. These Senators are trying to damage privacy & security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators.,"[**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

While  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,”   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.

The EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters’  strategy is clear. Because  they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to  insist it doesn’t affect encryption.

“This  bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness.

It’s  true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.

The  19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won’t be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress. 

The  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.

We track & coordinate anti-poaching rangers in the field with these PC's + GPS. F* You Microsoft!,"##[We were asked to do an AMA about our operation here.. it's right now (starting 4:30pm EST) at this link.. Thanks alot!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4mirin/i_am_the_accidental_it_guy_antipoaching_pilot_in/)  
## Btw, Final Win X data usage here: 17GB!  :|
  

***   
   
Self Explanatory. Aside from the fact that we pay per MB, and already share a slow connection, if a forced upgrade happened and crashed our pc's while in the middle of coordinating rangers under fire from armed militarized poachers.. blood could literally be on MS's hands. I just came here recently to act as their pilot.. but have IT skills as well. The guy who set these pc's up didn't know how to prevent it, or set a metered connection. I am completely livid.   [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/97G7RuX)

***Edit***: **Just want to say thanks for the interest and donations!** I was just trying to blow off some steam. It's a stressful environment to be sure. And to those criticizing about the lack of proper IT staff.. There's a lot of things we could wish for. You just try to do the best you can with what's available.. this is the bush.. and it's a worthy cause.  
   
It's against the rules for me to post links here, but a mod has given permission to mention our facebook page (where you can learn more about our work and how you can support with our linked crowdfunding page). Simply search for **""Chinko Project, CAR""** in the facebook search box. Also, If you are interested in seeing more about our operation (imgur albums) check out my comment below (with proof too).. thanks alot  
   
***Edit #2***: /u/FATstuntman suggested that if we raised the money for the ultralight plane, we name it Planey McPlaneface. You're damn straight we would! :)  
   
***Final Edit***: Once the generators are turned off, the batteries to keep the internet up won't last all night. A few people have asked for an AMA.. I can speak towards bush flying in general & bush IT stuff.. but I'll get my founder to join in and answer the cooler questions about anti-poaching life & the organization. So if you're interested, we'll try to set that up for Saturday the 4th @ 11:30 EST :) thanks everyone.

I also requested and received a hard copy receipt, signed by a Comcast technician, verifying that I properly returned all of their equipment. Despite all that, I have been repeatedly billed for $360 in Unreturned Equipment fees. I have of course repeatedly and firmly disputed the fees but have not been able to get them removed.

Every single step of my Comcast Equipment Return process is well documented [HERE] (http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannfuria/definitive-proof-it-is-impossible-to-avoid-comcast-wji6) and includes yet another Comcast audio recording.

Comcast additionally slammed me with a $960 Termination Fee for closing my account.

Due to an enormity of issues with my Comcast account and customer service, I began thoroughly documenting and recording my interactions with Comcast back in January of 2014.  My Comcast story has gotten a little bit of coverage by Gawker and The Verge in the past three days.

technology,apu3oz,"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet.","I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit.

technology,43fi39,I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

technology,6ivklm,"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined. Reddit, This could be as big as SOPA.","Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.

technology,2duzfi,Comcast’s Corporate response to my recent Reddit front page post (“Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees”) sends clear message: Comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,"*Before I can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, I beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.*

I am Dann Furia, OP of [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) which made the top spot on Reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common Comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “Unreturned” equipment and other fees.

**The purpose of this post is two-fold:**

* Share my (previously untold on Reddit) entire Comcast story
* Address Comcast’s response to my recent front page Reddit post about Comcast’s fees


**Part I - MY ENTIRE COMCAST STORY**

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.  

But believe me when I say this with heartfelt sincerity: I feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",44514,2192,1408338226.0,Comcast,0.92,True,False,dannfuria,https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2duzfi/comcasts_corporate_response_to_my_recent_reddit/,top,medium

science,7e1jo1,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia and hope you will join the conversation on http://www.wired.com/maketechhuman. Learn more about my foundation here: http://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/ 
 

Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions. 
 

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.


**Moderator Note**

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  

Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.**

politics,kwqdsf,Megathread: House Votes to Impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection,"The U.S. House of Representatives voted today to impeach President Donald J. Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

politics,i4ulnr,[Megathread] NY Attorney General Moves to Dissolve the NRA After Fraud Investigation,"The Attorney General of New York took action today to dissolve the National Rifle Association, following an 18-month investigation that found evidence the powerful gun rights group is ""fraught with fraud and abuse.""

Attorney General Letitia James claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday that she found financial misconduct in the millions of dollars, and that it contributed to a loss of more than $64 million over a three year period.

The state's top prosecutor said the organization engaged in illegal conduct by diverting ""millions of dollars away from the charitable mission of the organization for personal use by senior leadership, awarding contracts to the financial gain of close associates and family, and appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty.

Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

politics,dejfnt,Megathread: Federal Judge Rules President Trump Must Turn Over Eight Years Of Personal And Corporate Tax Returns,"A federal judge on Monday rejected a bold argument from President Trump that sitting presidents are immune from criminal investigations, allowing the Manhattan district attorney’s office to subpoena eight years of the president’s personal and corporate tax returns.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

politics,eizr6l,"Susan Collins has failed the people of Maine and this country. She has voted to confirm Trump’s judicial nominees, approve tax cuts for the rich, and has repeatedly chosen to put party before people. I am running to send her packing. I’m Betsy Sweet, and I am running for U.S. Senate in Maine. AMA.","Thank you so much for your thoughtful questions! As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby

* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom

* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan

* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance
Founding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.

* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. 

* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. 

I am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy.

politics,wjoj1w,Megathread: FBI Searches Former President Donald Trump's Florida Home,"Former President Donald J. Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

gaming,7cog1u,Can we please boycott Star Wars battlefront 2,"I bought EA Star Wars Battlefront as a fan of Star Wars and felt ripped off. Played the beta of Star Wars battlefront 2 and you still can't just get in a vehicle, it feels so fake. Why is Rey in the clone wars!? That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. 

I've had enough. 

#boycottswbf2

#boycottea

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.  

Edit 3: Thank you kind strangers for the reddit gold!

gaming,8swmb2,"Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views.","EDIT 5: Just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. 

There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.

Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)

I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.

**EDIT 2:**

I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.

Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.

**EDIT 4:**

I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.

It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.

-------------------

Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY

Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/

\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement.

I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.

He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!

Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. 




EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.

---------------


**EDIT 3:***

~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.

> Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. 

> Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.

> This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted.  Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.

gaming,7cx0ga,A message to those calling EA for a refund: be nice to the people taking your calls.,"Let's face it, this debacle with EA is terrible.  It's shady.  It is, according to the internet, worth hundreds of thousands of downvotes.  And now, on top of everything, if you want to remedy the situation you are forced to sit in an exaggerated phone line.

But keep in mind, the people taking your call at EA are having a much worse day than you!  These people are not the CEO, they're not the game designers, and they may not even be located in the same building as these people.  They are just trying to do their job, and it just so happens that they work at a company currently undergoing a pseudo scandal.

So be kind to them.  Because at the end of the day, they probably hate EA right now too.


Edit 1: Thank you, kind Redditor, for the Gold!  And thank you to the community for supporting the idea of showing kindness to others!

Edit 2: Thank you to the other four Gold-givers as well!  We almost hit #1 on the front page, but I think we topped out at #2.  I'm happy to see that a positive post was able to reach so high in the midst of this event!

Edit 3: I'd like to extend (likely) one last thank you to the Redditor who awarded this post its sixth gold, and to the community that actually took this post to #1 on the main page.  The Reddit community never ceases to amaze me, and I'm glad everyone could agree to support the idea of promoting human kindness.

movies,ha4t7t,"Adam Sandler said he would make a terrible film if he didn't win a Best Actor Academy Award for Uncut Gems. To help him out, I analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad Sandler film entitled 'Jacked Up'","Earlier in the year, Adam Sandler was a guest on Howard Stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *Uncut Gems*. During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12):

“If I don’t get it, I’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.”

In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (I’ll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is:

* *Jacked Up*
* Directed by Dennis Dugan
* Written By - Tim Herlihy
* PG-13
* Running Time: 135 minutes
* Released on Netflix
* Predicted Tomatometer score - 6%
* Predicted IMDb score - 3.75

Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled “*Jacked Up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino.

[Another very fun poster!](https://imgur.com/a/k1X5rUq)

This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible.

* *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday
* *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married
* *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy
* *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman
* *The Do-Over (10%)*  \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married
* *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married
* *Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday
* *Blended* (14%) - He’s a dad who travels to Africa
* *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action
* *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding
* *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn’t statistically a good thing

**Here’s all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up***

* A trademark of Sandler’s latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn’t travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*.
* Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I’m giving him the director’s chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.*
* Aside from *You Don’t Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn’t win him many points. That’s why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot.
* His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It’s a double whammy
* I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though
* His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13
* I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores.
* Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%).
* None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten
* In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn’t an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can’t be a doofus during the action scenes.
* Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn’t adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%).
* His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*.
* \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren’t traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren’t huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature.
* His first or last name couldn’t begin with an “R” -  Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*).

**WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?**

* He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don’t have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I’m going with that.

He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films

https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff647a066806a5dfbf516fd83ebff761d79621dc

* There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good.
* In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ccf8ee14641d421c38e2c0775f00299e517d83

* It’s best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%).
* Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles.

**Poster**

* Title centered
* Sandler(s) on left side - Full body
* At least six other characters on the poster

There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*.

those are two huge action movies and they are both being praised. Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.

movies,azonzz,"[OPINION] Rich filmmakers who probably haven't paid money to go see a film in a regular modern cinema in years/decades need to stop running their mouths about ""the sanctity of the movie theater experience"" and admonishing home viewing, which is often a far purer film experience these days.","Rant forthcoming...  


No shortage of recent examples, the most prominent obviously being Spielberg's alleged attempts to get made-for-streaming films banned from the Oscars.  


To be clear right off the bat - **I love the cinema experience**. Or rather, the *ideal* cinema experience. But that's become *so rare* as to be a complete gamble these days, and very often ends up being the *shitty* cinema experience. Whereas I can watch a movie at home and *know* it's not going to get diminished or outright ruined by any number of constant social or technical problems.  


Do any of the free premieres and private screenings Spielberg attends include people browsing Instagram on their blinding white phones every 20 minutes, or unchecked kids talking or crying? Has he dealt with people constantly getting up and walking through your FOV to go to the bathroom or get snacks at *inexplicable* times during a film, breaking your immersion? Or not being able to afford to see more than one film every month or two due to increasingly ridiculous costs?  


There's also the technical issues which have become outright depressing now. 3D looks *terrible* compared to Blu-Ray - dark, blurry, thoroughly diluting of anything the cinematographer was trying to accomplish - but is often the only option available to see something depending on where you live. There are films I don't even feel like I've *seen* until watching them properly at home, because the 3D muddled things so badly. Sound has also become an issue - contrary to the idea that a home audio setup can never compete with the cinema, I've found that theater sound is absolutely pathetic these days compared to watching Netflix with a good pair of headphones, and am often straining to hear dialogue and am utterly unmoved by the weak music. The only consistent exception there is IMAX and UltraAVX which is gloriously loud, but that can be a problem too if it's, for example, a Nolan film, who for all his big talk about the theater experience is one of of the worst offenders for ruining it with his infamously shrill mixing that leaves viewers covering their ears, only able to enjoy his work in a controlled environment months later at home.  


The ""movie theater experience"" is great when it's the good version - nobody on their phones, nobody misbehaving, perfect picture and audio, within your budget, a whole audience communally having a great time being immersed in a film together. In practice however, this perfect storm of awesome happens maybe one in five times by my reckoning these days, and more often than not it's way more immersive, impressive and pure to watch a film on an HD screen with headphones, no distractions and privacy at home. So the Hollywood elite needs a reality check about the evils of watching their films on the small screen - it's often the only way to really appreciate them now.",62213,4491,1552276744.0,,0.77,True,False,__secter_,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/azonzz/opinion_rich_filmmakers_who_probably_havent_paid/,top,high

movies,a68vzl,"If Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers had switched roles with Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, both movies would've been significantly better.","In Valerian you could have Chris Pratt as the handsome and cocky Special Operative with his sexy, ass-kicking co-pilot in Lawrence.  They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get.   It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline.   
  
On the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger.  Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him.    
  
I think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat?  It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling.     
  
I also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that **I** wanted it to be).  Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker:     
  
Keep it mostly the same through the first two acts.  Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane.  Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship.  She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted.  Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on.  That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship.  You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.

movies,cahtb1,"Opinion: I think it was foolish of Disney to remake so many of their popular movies within the span of a year: Dumbo, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan. If they had spaced them out to maybe 1 or 2 a year, they might each be received better; but now people are getting weary, and Disney's greed is showing.","I know their executives are under pressure to perform, but that's the problem when capitalism overrides common sense in entertainment; they want to make the most money for the quarterly/yearly record-books and don't always consider the long-term.  IMO each of the films in the Disney Renaissance years could have pulled them a lot of money if they had released them over the course of a few years.  Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.  But if Disney forces its supply on movie goers, they might just find people balking at its oversaturation of the market and so may rebel in their entertainment choices some way, reflecting in lower revenue for Disney.  As it's said in Spiderman, ""with great power comes great responsibility;"" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it.",59731,4437,1562569766.0,,0.82,True,False,GoRush87,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cahtb1/opinion_i_think_it_was_foolish_of_disney_to/,top,high

The emotions that come from a triumphant yet bittersweet ending begin to settle. And as the screen fades to black, and you feel the catharsis that comes from watching an epic film take hold....

A bright title card for Suits comes up.

Who has ever finished a film and on finishing it clicks the recommended film straight away?  And yet the ads come up, every single time. It completely ruins the moment. And yes, you can click the box to continue watching the credits- but why should we even have to do that? Why is it so hard for Netflix to not promote their material for five minutes after a film ends?

In a life bombarded by advertisements do we have to be shown another one the second a film finishes? Is there no respite? 

From what I've seen online there isn't a way to disable this specific feature (though I would really love to be proven wrong on this one).

movies,45sul3,"Okay Hollywood, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters?","I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.

I'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. 

The most common justification for things not being R is ""they make less money"" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. 

But adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  

[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) 

If it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. 

Hell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. 

And Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said.

Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.

movies,eh71gy,I saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. Here is my full ranking.,"This year I went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

This is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in:

--------------------------------------------------------

**Monos - 10/10** - *Hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. It's Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies, with some Beasts of No Nation thrown in. It builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. Beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). Modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a Colombian jungle. It almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which I really loved. You get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. Unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. Got a lot out of its cast. Can't recommend this movie enough. Really disappointed this didn't make the Best Foreign Language Film shortlist. ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.*

**Marriage Story - 10/10**

**The Farewell - 10/10**

**Journey to a Mother's Room - 9/10** - *Biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. Deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. It's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at Point A, and end at Point A), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. If you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. It's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. It only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. Beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.*

**Waves - 9/10** - *I could write 20 pages on how much I loved this movie. To keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from Kelvin Harrison Jr., Sterling K. Brown, and Taylor Russell). Visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. Unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. It takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. It's also the only movie I went to see twice this year. Really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. Would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. Every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. Just watch this.*

**Last Black Man In San Francisco - 9/10**

**Birds of Passage - 9/10**

**Apollo 11 - 9/10** - *The best documentary of the year. Probably the best editing (and use of sound) I've ever seen/heard in a documentary. It's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. Impressive use of archival footage/audio.*

**Uncut Gems - 9/10** - *This movie wasn't on the Best Original Score shortlist for the 2020 Oscars. This aggression will not stand.*

**The Mustang - 9/10**

**Wild Rose - 9/10** - *If this doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song ('Glasgow'), I've lost all faith in the Academy. The ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. Jessie Buckley is gonna be big. Best music-drama since A Star Is Born.*

**Transit  - 9/10**

**Ad Astra - 9/10** - *Top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful VFX, engaging score. Best opening scene of the year. Thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a Heart of Darkness blanket. If you're into space/exploration movies, then I recommend this. Surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.*

**The Report  - 9/10** - *This was a really good year for legal-thrillers and The Report was the cream of the crop. Tight, Sorkin-like script with top performances from Adam Driver & Annette Bening. Could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.*

**Parasite - 9/10**

**Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - 9/10**

**Midnight Traveler - 9/10** - *If you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. It puts everything in a different perspective. Every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. It's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.*

**Luce - 9/10** - *It's Kelvin Harrison Jr's world and we're just living in it.*

**The Irishman - 8/10**

**Mickey and the Bear - 8/10** - *Camila Morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. PTSD, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural Montana, toxic relationships, James Badge Dale, following your dreams. What's not to love?*

**The Art of Self Defense - 8/10** - *The best dark-comedy of the year. So many great one liners. It's like Yorgos Lanthimos directing Death of Stalin, set in a karate studio. Surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. Jesse Eisenberg's best movie since.....The Social Network?*

**Peanut Butter Falcon - 8/10** - *""Am I going to die?"" ""We all do, it's only a 
matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - Favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.*

**Everybody Knows - 8/10**

**Mary Magdalene - 8/10**

**Knives Out - 8/10** - *Well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. Just a genuinely fun time at the movies. Ana de Armas with well-deserved leading role for once. A few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. Daniel Craig hamming it up with a Southern accent was fun. Old school film with a modern twist.*

**The Lighthouse - 8/10** 

**The Dead Don't Die - 8/10** - *This movie really isn't for everyone, but I loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. The line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. Everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. I could watch 10 hours of Tom Waits talking to himself.*

**Us - 8/10**

**Villains - 8/10**

**Ford v Ferrari  - 8/10** 

**Midsommar - 8/10**

**Jojo Rabbit  - 8/10** 

**Official Secrets - 8/10** - *Keira Knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. Another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.*

**Pain & Glory - 8/10** 

**John Wick 3: Parabellum - 8/10**

**Queen & Slim - 8/10**

**Amazing Grace - 8/10** - *Great concert-documentary. Some of Aretha Franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. I actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. Felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. One of my few revised scores this year.*

**A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - 8/10**

**Joker - 8/10**

**Non-Fiction - 8/10** - *It's very French (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself,  but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. I'm a big fan of Olivier Assayas and this is some of his best work.*

**Rocketman - 8/10**

**Stan & Ollie - 8/10**

**Hustlers - 8/10**

**Avengers Endgame - 8/10**

**Doctor Sleep - 8/10** - *It gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to The Shining. Didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.*

**Booksmart - 8/10** 

**Little Monsters  - 8/10** - *I'd recommend watching this based just on Josh Gad's character. So over-the-top and hilarious. When he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most I laughed in a theater this year. Also Lupita Nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what I needed in my life. Cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.*

**Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8/10**

**A Hidden Life - 8/10** - *If there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that I'd want played at my funeral, it's James Newton Howard's theme from this movie. It's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. That song broke me down every time it played. I can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. It's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.*

**Never Look Away - 8/10**

**Toy Story 4 - 8/10**

**Pavarotti - 8/10**

**The Biggest Little Farm - 8/10**-  *If you're really into the inner-workings of a Californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.*

**Abominable - 8/10**  

**The Current War - 7/10** 

**Artic  - 7/10** - *Well made, solidly-acted. I loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. I'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.*

**Bombshell - 7/10**

**Honey Boy - 7/10** - *Pretty big letdown because I had really high expectations for this one. Lacked the emotional punch I hoped for. Didn't land for me at all, kind of like Boy Erased last year. I appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for Shia LaBeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. Lucas Hedges' Shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. Mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and I expected the same for this. It was good, not great.*

**American Woman - 7/10** - *Sienna Miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. The accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. The movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. It's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.*

**The Beach Bum - 7/10**

**Captain Marvel - 7/10**

**Spies In Disguise - 7/10** - *Looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.*

**Cold Pursuit - 7/10**

**Tolkien - 7/10** - *Not much happens but it felt really comfortable. Solid performances all around and they handled the WW1 scenes better than I thought they would. Expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. As far as ""Nicholas Hoult Biopics of Famous Writers"" go, it's miles ahead of Rebel in the Rye 2 years ago.*

**Jumanji: The Next Level - 7/10**

**Sauvage/Wild - 7/10**

**Detective Pikachu - 7/10**

**Maiden - 7/10**

**Dark Waters - 7/10** - . *Good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. Total waste of Anne Hathaway. She's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. Not even sure why she was in this. Overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre I really enjoy and I've been missing since its late-90s heyday. Pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like The Insider). Should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose*

**Adopt A Highway - 7/10**

**The Wedding Guest - 7/10**

**The Hummingbird Project - 7/10**

**Motherless Brooklyn - 7/10**

**The Lion King - 7/10**

**Last Christmas - 7/10** - *It's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but I couldn't help walking out with a smile. I love how committed Emilia Clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. Also did I mention how ridiculous that twist is?*

**Richard Jewell  - 7/10** - *This was decent. Even though it's clearly Clint Eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the FBI & the Spooky Media™, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. Some of the characters (Hamm/Wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, I mean come on. You just roll your eyes at most of what they say. Some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. It had very solid performances (Hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). Much better than The Mule, and 20x better than 15:17 To Paris.*

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker - 7/10**

**21 Bridges - 7/10**

**Before You Know It - 7/10**

**Hobbs & Shaw - 7/10** - *This is peak ""Stupid Summer Popcorn Movie"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's The Meg of 2019*.

**Fighting With My Family - 7/10**

**Pet Sematary  - 7/10**

**Downton Abbey - 7/10** - *Never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.*

**Yesterday - 7/10**

**Greta  - 7/10** - *It's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but I liked it. Sometimes you just need Isabelle Hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. Felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.*

**Judy - 7/10** - *It's the definition of Oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a Hollywood legend.*

**Frozen 2  - 7/10**

**Aladdin - 7/10**

**The Souvenir - 7/10**

**Zombieland 2: Double Tap - 7/10** - *Nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the Thomas Middleditch/Luke Wilson scene). Above-average for a comedy-sequel, but I could see this one not aging well*.

**The Two Popes - 6/10** - *Two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough Pryce/Hopkins. Reminded me of Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. Highly-overrated movie.*

**Ready Or Not - 6/10**

**Anna - 6/10** - *It's basically Red Sparrow but slightly worse*.

**Saint Frances  - 6/10**

**Hotel Mumbai - 6/10** 

**Shazam! - 6/10** - *Low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. It hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. It was decent.*

**Alita: Battle Angel - 6/10**

**Loro - 6/10** - *One of the more disappointing movies of the year. On paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt Italian politician/mogul by Paolo Sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? Sign me the fuck up. But nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. Too much shoehorned religious imagery too. Tone is all over the place. It can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. It looked nice at least. It also wins this year's ""Most Nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.*

**Teen Spirit - 6/10**

**The Upside - 6/10**

**Gloria Bell - 6/10** - *Great performance from Julianne Moore but this just felt like ""Middle-Aged Crisis: The Movie"". Just couldn't connect to it. I imagine the original is a lot better.*

**On The Basis Of Sex - 6/10**

**Stockholm - 6/10**

**Give Me Liberty  - 6/10**  - *This is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. There's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. It's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. A lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but I don't see it. Rough editing, bad soundtrack.*

**Child's Play - 6/10**

**Good Boys - 6/10** - *Just watch Booksmart instead*.

**Styx - 6/10**

**Woman at War - 6/10**

**The Lego Movie 2 -  6/10**

**Missing Link - 6/10**

**Long Shot - 6/10** - *The chemistry between Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. It's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.*

**Echo in the Canyon - 6/10**

**Cyrano, My Love - 6/10**

**Dora the Explorer - 6/10**

**Brittany Runs A Marathon - 6/10**

**IT: Chapter 2 - 6/10** - *Way too long. Felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. Good CGI & acting though.*

**Mister America - 6/10**

**Crawl - 6/10**

**Trial By Fire - 6/10** - *Great performances by Laura Dern & Jack O'Connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. It doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.*

**The Third Wife - 6/10**

**Godzilla: King of Monsters - 5/10** - *This needed less humans, more monsters.*

**Glass - 5/10**

**Escape Room - 5/10**

**Terminator: Dark Fate - 5/10**

**Brightburn  - 5/10**

**The White Crow - 5/10** - *One of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. Reading the Wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an Oscar contender. Instead it was just okay. Watch Cold War instead. It's basically this movie but better.*

**High Life - 5/10** - *Unpleasant.*

**Where'd You Go Bernadette? - 5/10**

**Scary Stories to Tell Dark - 5/10**

**Her Smell - 5/10** - *This movie made me physically nauseous. The tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. It's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from Elisabeth Moss. But then deflated by a terrible final scene.*

**By the Grace of God - 5/10** - *Based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, I walked in expected to be blown away. Basically expected Spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. Hard to sit through*.

**Blinded by the Light - 5/10**

**The Best of Enemies - 5/10**

**The Aeronauts - 5/10** - *This is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.*

**Fall of the American Empire - 5/10**

**Family - 5/10**

**The Goldfinch - 5/10** - *It turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? Shoutout to Jeffrey Wright & Finn Wolfhard for actually trying.*

**Angel Has Fallen - 5/10**

**Gemini Man - 5/10** 

**Late Night  - 5/10**

**Black and Blue  - 5/10** 

**Diane - 5/10** - *This was just depression-porn. Sometimes it works (Mungiu/Zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). It's such a bummer. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Mary Kay Place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.*

**Destroyer - 5/10**

**How To Train Your Dragon 3 - 5/10**

**Rafiki - 5/10** - *I feel bad for this score because I get that this is a really important/significant movie for African Cinema, but I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. Again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. Felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.*

**Captive State - 4/10**

**Wild Nights With Emily - 4/10** - *This movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned Emily Dickinson's life into an SNL skit?"". I get what they were going for, and Molly Shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie I've ever seen.*

**Dark Pheonix - 4/10**

**The Addams Family - 4/10**

**Midway  - 4/10**

**To Dust - 4/10**

**Rojo - 4/10** - *The only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. So that was cool, I guess.*

**The Kid Who Would Be King - 4/10**

**MIB: International - 4/10**

**The Kid - 4/10** - *There's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. It somehow got 2 big names (Pratt & Hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. Directed by Vincent D'Onofrio for some reason (???). Was dumped by Lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. It's dated, boring, and unoriginal. Cheesy dialogue. Literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. No reason for this to exist. Chris Pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.*

**Ramen Shop - 4/10**

**The Good Liar - 4/10**- *The most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. Helen Mirren & Ian McKellen both phone it in (I don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). I hate when movies try to crowbar ""WW2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.*

**Climax - 4/10**

**Harriet - 4/10** 

**Lucy in the Sky - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. This is that movie. Natalie Portman had another movie like that last year (Vox Lux). Hey Noah Hawley, what the fuck?*

**Freaks - 4/10** - *This movie would fit well in the ""Good Idea But Bad Execution"" subreddit.*

**Tel Aviv On Fire - 4/10**

**Ma - 4/10**

**Frankie  -  3/10**

**Stuber - 3/10**

**Serenity - 3/10** - *In a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, Last Christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. It's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. How they got A-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. It's almost ""so bad its good"". Almost. I can't wait for the sequel, Free Guy, next year.*

**Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil - 3/10** - *More genocide than I expected for a live-action Disney fairy tale movie.*

**Donnybrook - 3/10**

**The Photograph - 3/10** - *Zzzzzzzzzz...*

**Charlie's Angels - 3/10**

**Hellboy - 3/10** - *This movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. It's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. It reminded me of the Predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid I guess). Bad CGI and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which I hate.*

**Happy Death Day 2U** - 3/10 - 

**The Sun Is Also A Star** - 3/10 - *It's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.*

**Don't Let Go** - 3/10

**The Invisibles** - 3/10

**Playing with Fire  - 3/10** - *This was just like Mark Wahlberg's Instant Family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. No lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. It was the only time I even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.*

**Cats - 2/10** - *There's not much more I could say that already hasn't been said. Yes, it was bad. No, it wasn't the worst movie in history. For me, it was just so boring. Forgettable songs (except Beautiful Ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. Just wanted it to end. Jennifer Hudson just floating into space for no reason, Judi Dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, Ian McKellen slurping milk from a bowl, Extremely-Hairy-And-Naked-Idris-Elba, Cockroach Genocide, etc. These things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.*

**Rambo: Last Blood - 2/10**

**The Sound of Silence - 2/10** - *More like The Sound of Boredom, amirite? No but seriously, that's all I got. This movie was the closest I got to falling asleep in my seat this year.*

**Synonyms - 2/10**

**Black Christmas - 2/10** - *Extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end Blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2D characters. Shitty ending. Wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. About as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. Amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.*

**After the Wedding - 2/10** - *Overacted, muddled garbage.*

**47 Meters Down Uncaged - 1/10**

**Shaft - 1/10** - *Crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. There's a million adjectives I could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. This is one I'm surprised I didn't just walk out of. Probably didn't have anything better do do that day.*

**Jexi - 1/10** - *This year's worst movie. It's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. It was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. Not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. There are no redeeming factors. On the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. No memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. None of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. If you had a freshman high-school film student remake Her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. The fact that I paid money to see this is something I will never live down.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Other:**

* The longest stretch I went without going to the movies was from July 21st thru August 20th, without a single trip to the movies. Partially due to an out-of-country trip and personal stuff. During this time I ""missed out"" on **The Kitchen**, **The Nightingale**, **Brian Banks**, and **Honeyland**. Mostly caught up to the rest.
* The most theater visits in a one-week span was November 1st thru November 8th, with 8 movies that week.
* The most in one day was 3 movies in theaters on March 15th, 2019 (**Styx**, **To Dust**, and **Captive State**).
* There were 26 double-headers this year (two movies in theaters during the same day, usually back-to-back).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solid year, not as many surprises as 2018 though. Going to try to break 200 in 2020.

movies,79fvp8,"Watch John Wick 1 & 2. Then watch Constantine. Constantine feels like a sequel in a series where our protagonist, John, develops the ability to fight Hell itself. The continuity is made possible because everyone refers to the character as “John” and treats him with a reserved respect.","This a very cool continuity exercise, one that I accidentally stumbled upon in a search to watch movies with detached heroes doing the “right” thing out of obligation. Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as “John” goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it’s Keanu’s cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity.

movies,ffyvir,Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010s. I watched all of them.,"A couple of weeks ago, I showed my son National Treasure, and the whole time I kept thinking “damn, I really miss Nic Cage”. I knew that he was pretty much in the DTV world for the past 10 years, but I didn’t realize to what level. Turns out that Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010’s, and almost immediately, I was determined to watch every one of them. So I did. In no particular order:  
  
**The Trust. 7/10.**  
A not half-bad way to start things off. It's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and Elijah Wood play well of each other. Cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. There's a good story here but it's never fully realized. We are treated to a Cage Out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go.  
  
**Kill Chain. 8/10.**  
This one was really enjoyable! It's sort-of 3 different stories or vignettes that all come together in the second half, which is where Cage enters the picture. He never Cage's Out, playing pretty restrained the whole time (though there is one moment where he comes close). The writing's a bit ham-fisted, and the characters are pure stereotype, but it's well crafted and a very entertaining 90 minutes. So far so good. With 27 to go, things are looking up!  
  
**The Runner. 5/10.**  
Unfocused and uneventful. It’s well cast and there’s a feeling of “this is a real movie” but it wants to be too many things. There’s a decent movie buried in here, but at a brisk 82 minutes, it’s hard to find. There’s no Cage Rage on display here, instead playing it very understated. It’s quality acting though. Three films into this little odyssey, and so far these are more than just paychecks for him, doing the best he can with what he’s given.  
  
**Rage. 6/10.**  
It’s OK, but it’s sloppy. The whole time I’m wondering why nothing seems to piece together, and it’s ultimately all in service of a shock ending that undermines everything that came before. Once again, Cage is solid in this. He keeps things entertaining where others may have had me checking out. One intense Cage Out, but I expected more based on the title and premise. Nevertheless, we journey forward. 4 down, 25 to go.  
  
**Between Worlds. 10/10.**  
I’m going to be fast and loose with the spoilers on this one. Joe is a down-on-his-luck truck driver who lost his wife and kid to a house fire some years prior. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Joe is at a gas station pit stop where he finds Julie being choked out by some dude. Joe steps in and knocks him out, much to her dissatisfaction. Why? Because 1 hour prior, her daughter was in a motorcycle accident and is now in a coma, and because of a childhood incident, knows that if she is unconscious she can cross over to “the other side”. So her plan was to have some rando choke her in a rest stop bathroom so she could guide her daughter back to the land of the living. Joe interrupted the process, so he offers to give her a ride to the hospital. Once there, she asks Joe to choke her in the hallway so she can try again to reach her. “Something” goes wrong, and instead, Joe’s dead wife is brought back in the daughters body.  
The next 30 minutes see Joe moving in with Julie and playing house while dead-wife-in-daughter (DWID from this point on) slowly creeps around trying to seduce him. It’s the halfway point when Joe is made aware what is happening, and by extension Julie and the movies 1 other character. They all accept this very easily.  
It’s around this time that we get to a scene where Joe and DWID are fucking, interspersed with a scene where Joe and his wife before she died are also fucking. In both of these scenarios, his wife wants him to read poetry while they fuck. The poetry Joe proceeds to read in both scenes is from a book titled, I shit you not, “Memories by Nicolas Cage”.  
More stuff happens, and at the end of the movie, through various circumstances, Joe is doing a classic Cage scream-cry, one arm hugging a jack-in-the-box that presumably belonged to his daughter, and in the other, he is dousing himself in gasoline. He then lights a cigarette, which of course ignites his entire body, and he smokes in a completely normal manner while his body burns. This all happens while Leader of the Pack is playing, a song that holds absolutely no significance to anything that has come prior.  
Throughout, music that feels directly ripped from Twin Peaks is playing, and the whole atmosphere is begging to feel like David Lynch. Is the kind of movie you would find on Cinemax at 2am on a random Wednesday in 1995. It’s fucking glorious.  
At this particular moment in my life, my greatest fear is that with 24 films to go, I will never again reach these heights.  
  
**Inconceivable. 7/10.**  
It’s your typical nanny-isn’t-who-they-seem-to-be sort of deal, but it’s actually entertaining enough. It’s all pretty rote stuff, but there’s nothing offensively bad here. Cage gets 4th billing, with absolutely nothing to do other than play the can’t-see-what’s-really-going-on husband. He’s still decent at it, but this actually does feel like a paycheck movie for him, given that I can’t find any reason he would have looked at the script and thought he had something interesting he could do.  
  
**The Humanity Bureau. 3/10.**  
Lame, cheap, uninteresting near-future story that doesn’t have anything new to say that hasn’t already been said better in dozens of other movies. Cage is actually asleep at the wheel on this one, just kind of making his way through. In fairness, he isn’t given anything to do. Thus far, these movies have managed pretty decent supporting casts. Here though, it’s pretty much Canadian TV extras. Things are starting to feel rocky with 22 left.  
  
**Outcast. 4/10.**  
Meh. Anakin Skywalker is a 12th Century Knight escorting hunted royalty to safe haven. It’s surprisingly not as cheap as I expected, but it’s a completely unoriginal and boring movie. My only reason for watching, Sir Nicolas, does not even enter the picture until the final 30 minutes. He really hams it up with the old English accent, but he can’t save the movie at this point. Things are gonna need to start turning around soon. Maybe a Between Worlds injection every 3 movies.  
  
**Primal. 6/10.**  
A movie where a Jaguar, a killer and Nicolas Cage are all loose on a boat in the middle of the ocean should not be this dull. It’s no fault of Cage, who hurls some great insults throughout when not chomping on a cigar, and the rest of the cast seems game (except you, Jean Grey), so it really comes down to the film itself, which just doesn’t use its premise to the fullest. The whole thing is visually bland, too. It’s so muted it borders on black and white sometimes.  
I had high hopes going in, but thanks to this little journey of mine, I now know director Nick Powell from yesterday’s Outcast endeavor, and as soon as his name popped up in the opening credits, those hopes came crashing down.  
  
**Running with the Devil. 7/10.**  
Flawed and sloppily made, but still entertaining enough, mostly due to its surprisingly A-list cast that never gets to do much. It's not nearly as cool as it wants to be though. What Feast made a great joke about in its opening few minutes, this movie tries to do for real, to eye rolling effect. Cage is very low-key in this, with Laurence Fishburne of all people having the most fun. His characters sexual proclivities serve no purpose, and an early montage of them would be pointless if he wasn't so much fun to watch. Perhaps the biggest disappointment though is that Nicolas Cage and Adam Goldberg get some screen time together, and rather than take this opportunity to have them out-anxious each other, nothing comes of it. I'm so d-d-d-d-d-disappointed.  
  
**A Score to Settle. 8/10.**  
Went in expecting a typical revenge flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see something more. Cage is really great in this, and I'm more and more impressed by him with each movie. He really disappears into each role, never doing the same thing twice even if he sometimes is playing similar characters. There are a few moments of the Cage Madness here, much in the same way that Christopher Walken or Sam Rockwell try to dance in every movie they do, but the more subdued acting takes center stage.  
  
**The Frozen Ground. 8/10.**  
Tight cat-and-mouse type that focuses on the procedural more than the thriller aspect and is better for it. Cage is in top form, and Cusack ain't half bad either. Might I want to dip my toe into his DTV output next? Perhaps. 17 to go first.
  
**211. 1/10.**  
Jesus Fucking Christ.  
  
**Dying of the Light. 6/10.**  
**Dark. 7/10.**  
As it exists in its official form, it’s a middling CIA thriller with an intriguing Cage performance being the most interesting part.  
In it’s “Director’s Cut”, which is even less of an actual movie than Donner’s Superman II, everything is much more intriguing, and had Schrader been able to make an actual final cut, this could have had the potential to be great.
The concept of a dying CIA agent spending his last days trying to catch a dying terrorist is a solid one, but it isn’t fully realized in either version as is. Cage’s performance is a little manic in both, but more fleshed out and sympathetic in the later. CIA business aside, I’d have liked to watch 90 minutes of Cage just losing his mind. Actually that movie could be 3 hours long and still not be enough.  
  
**Stolen. 9/10.**  
A cheap Taken knock-off crossed with a heist movie that’s a stupid amount of fun. Josh Lucas is gloriously unhinged here, out Cage-ing the man himself. Can the remaining 14 keep up?  
  
**Arsenal. 5/10.**  
DTV mediocrity that tries too hard to be cool. Cage is hamming it up in a small-ish role, and certainly makes his scenes entertaining, but the rest of the DTV-All-Stars are bland.  
  
**Seeking Justice. 8/10.**  
It’s packaged as a revenge thriller, but it’s much more in line with 13 Sins/The Game/Nerve. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous, but it’s a lot of fun to watch. It doesn’t use its New Orleans setting as well as Stolen, but the two would make for a hell of a double feature.  
  
**Dog Eat Dog. 7/10.**  
Weird movie, but compellingly so. Shrader gets his editing jollies off that he couldn’t do on Dying of the Light, but I’m not sure it does much to add to a movie that is otherwise a pretty simple tale of low-level criminals wanting to hit it big. Cage and Dafoe is a great pairing, but it’s never fully utilized, outside of an odd, half-naked condiment fight.  
  
**Vengeance: A Love Story. ?/10.**  
After the first 10 minutes, where you can fill a card 100% while playing Cop Trope Bingo, you get the deformed child of two very different movies. In the first movie you have a fairly dark, if poorly constructed, movie about the aftermath of an assault and rape where any one aspect of which could have been explored, but instead the writer and director give us a Whitman's Sampler of plot threads with none of them fleshed out beyond the initial idea. Nicolas Cage is not in this movie.  
In the second movie however, Nicolas Cage stars in what I can only think to describe of as City of Angels 2. After tragically losing his dear Maggie to that damn logging truck, Seth moves out of LA and assumes the identity of John Drormoor, becoming a policeman who years later becomes involved in the lives of a mother and daughter in the aftermath of a violent attack. After what is obviously Seth/John trying to communicate with Cassiel at the edge of a waterfall for guidance, he is given a much warranted promotion from Angel to Avenging Angel, serving due justice to the duos attackers.  
These two movies have been edited together. I don't know how to give this a numbered rating. There are 10 remaining.  
  
**USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. 3/10.**  
A poorly made movie that plays like a work of complete fiction. The use of a famous quote 50 years before it was coined is particularly atrocious, as is Tom Sizemore, acting as though he were Tobias Fünke trying his best at an Academy Award.
This is the first straight-up bad movie thus far. Up until this point they’ve either crossed over into so-bad-they’re-good or Cage has given a performance that keeps things entertaining and watchable. USS Indianapolis is just a lame movie across the board.  
  
**Joe. 7/10.**  
A solid movie with a really great performance by Cage, but I found its most engaging storyline sidelined by too many others that make the movie feel really long. There is no fun to be had here, and little worth revisiting down the road.  
  
**Color Out of Space. 8/10.**  
Delivered what I was hoping for on most accounts, but continues to prove that adapting Lovecraft, especially on a low budget, is very difficult. There are some real horrors on display though proving that practical effects are still king, and Cage is great, showing again his talent and desire to really put his all into every role.  
  
**Grand Isle. 6/10.**  
A came cast keeps things going for the first hour, which is essentially a single location play, but it all starts to fall apart in the third act. Grammer has about 10 minutes of collective screen time and only 30 seconds of those shared with Cage. KaDee Strickland is the most surprising here, matching Cage's enthusiasm and keeping the whole thing very entertaining, but it ultimately amounts to very little. The low-budget also doesn't help, constantly referencing a hurricane that is never seen. A shame really, cause you can see the potential for something greater here.  
  
**Looking Glass. 5/10.**  
A thriller without thrills, trying so hard to be mysterious and failing at each try. Cage is given nothing to do but walk around and look confused for 100 minutes. Things rarely happen, and when they do they make no sense by the end. There's a solid first act setup with some cool ideas, and every single one is wasted. I was hoping for something along the lines of 8MM, but this was not that.  
The final 5 remain.  
  
**Mom and Dad. 8/10.**  
A deranged concept which Cage is perfectly suited for, but like my issue with Nicholson in The Shining, he’s already a little crazy before he goes crazy. I love the tone set with the opening credits, but Taylor goes to frenetic too quickly, never letting us settle in before cranking things up to 11.  
All that aside, it’s a totally bonkers movie and watching Cage let loose is always 100% entertainment. As a whole it just lacks the finesse to bump this up to top tier.  
  
**Trespass. 8/10.**  
There’s more than a few stupid character decisions, and I don’t love the way the flashback structure is done, but the performances across the board are really good, and the intensity level is consistent throughout.  
  
**Pay the Ghost. 7/10.**  
A pretty decent spookfest that creates a moody atmosphere and some chilling imagery. While “Color Out of Space” falls in the horror genre, and Cage has done more than a few thrillers, this is the only actual scary movie he’s ever done. I’d like to see more.  
  
**Army of One. 4/10.**  
Cage sounds like he’s doing a Rain Man impression the entire time, and the movie is narrated in a Wake Up, Ron Burgundy style which is just awful. A very unfunny movie that is more annoying than anything else.  
  
**Mandy. 10/10.**  
There was no better way to end this journey. Cage is smartly restrained for a majority of the picture, but when the beast is let loose, THE BEAST IS LET LOOSE! A fever dream of a movie that delivers on all accounts, and something that will be re-watched in years to come.

EDIT: In order to keep the title streamlined I said ""direct-to-video"". Perhaps what I should have said was ""movies that did not have a nationwide theatrical release"".

EDIT 2: You are all incredibly kind! I very much enjoyed this, and it only furthered my appreciation for Nic Cage. He currently has 4 movies in post-production, and I’m eager to watch each one of them. To answer a common question, each movie was reviewed on its own merits, and not on any sort of curve or in-comparison to another movie.

movies,k6ze6l,My 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. [SPOILERS],"Last year, I introduced him to Die Hard and I said it was one of my favorite Christmas movies. All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story. And he's 100% right; Lethal Weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of August. Christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. 

So I pointed out that Gruber's gang in Die Hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime Christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the FBI out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. 

You take Xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. 

And again, McClane is in that building specifically because it's Christmas. 

No Christmas, no Die Hard. 

He's not happy about it. 

So tomorrow we're going to have to watch Love Actually and see what he thinks.",48284,2724,1607135857.0,,0.79,True,False,gynoceros,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/k6ze6l/my_12_year_old_is_pissed_at_me_because_he/,top,medium

movies,aul7km,Disney lost the Best Animated Film for the first time since 2006,"After Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse won Best Animated Film last night, it got me thinking about how it seemed like finally an animated film not made by Disney or Pixar won that category. So I went and looked it up and sure enough, Disney/Pixar has won the Oscar in this category every single year they had a movie up for nomination, since 2006 (in 2011, they didn’t have a movie up for nomination AND YES, as everyone keeps asking in the comment section: Rango won this year. Disney did not have a movie nominated, and Rango won, and no, Rango is not a Disney movie). In 2006, they lost the Oscar to Happy Feet (the Disney movie up for nomination was Cars).

As much of a Disney movie lover as I am, I’m so glad that the Academy didn’t just blindly hand over the award to Disney again, but actually chose the best of the bunch. And I’m so glad it’s Into The Spider-Verse. This movie deserves it.

Edit: to all those confused about Marvel’s role in this movie, u/Viceprezbacon has a great comment below summarizing the relationships:
“To all confused about Disney and Spiderman. Sony owns the rights to spiderman. The Marvel attributed with being involved with this movie is the comic book company. Disney was in no way involved with this movie. They own Marvel Studios, who produce the live action movies and have no affiliation with Sony in this regard (outside the spiderman deal).”",47944,3238,1551101031.0,,0.9,True,False,just-_here-_to-_lurk,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/aul7km/disney_lost_the_best_animated_film_for_the_first/,top,medium

movies,9dsd2r,FUCK YOU NETFLIX STOP CUTTING OFF THE CREDITS,"You know that feeling when you've just watched two and a half hours of an amazing movie, and the credits roll, and the specially-composed-to-be-epic end-credits sountrack piece starts to play and you're like ""aaahhh... time to revel in the emotion of the ending of that film, and take a minute to think about what it all means as this beautiful epic music plays to recontextualize what I've seen and put it in a more viscer... OH FUCK WHY THE FUCK IS THE TRAILER FOR 'ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK' FUCKING UP MY SHIT!?!?!?!?!?!?""

Seriously, STOP FUCKING DOING THAT.  I KNOW YOUR SHOWS FUCKING EXIST.  LET ME HAVE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF COMEDOWN BEFORE SHOVELING YOUR NEXT SERIES IN MY GODDAMN FACE ALREADY"".

I mean, shit, if even there was a button that said ""let me watch the end credits"" I'd be OK with it, but NOPE THERE'S FUCKING NOTHING.

Netflix, you had our backs five years ago, and now you're just as fucking bad as anyone else.  LISTEN TO ME, STOP THIS SHIT.

(((( MEGA EDIT ))))

 Well... holy smokes, le blow up... and some of you have no sense of humour.  A few comments.

a) I don't hate Netflix in general.  People saying ""just stop paying for it"" are being ridiculous.  I even get that a lot of people *like* the autoplay feature, which is great.  I just don't like that it's *automatic* and there's no option to turn it off (for me, at least).

b) I think for some reason you guys have options when you watch that I don't.  None of your suggestions work for me, or seem available.  Probably depends how you're watching Netflix.  I'm using a Sony smart TV.  Maybe I truly am ""retarded"", as some of you insist.  But I don't have the settings menu ya'll are talking about, that's for sure.

c) I'm howling at the comments about ""entitlement"".  Uh, what?  I'm paying for a service here, not asking for my student loans to be cleared.  If we don't like something we're paying for, we're ""entitled"" so say something about it.

d) As for the ""don't get so excited"" posts.  Well, firstly, alcohol.  Secondly, obviously the issue isn't that big of a deal, that's why the obviously over the top response.  I dunno, I thought it was funny.  Certainly didn't think anyone would care about it.  What's really interesting is how pissed off people get that I even posted it in the first place.  Oh, sorry, let's get back to how exciting that fifth poster is for (insert 483rd Marvel sequel here).

e) Some of you don't sit through the credits.  That's cool, but some of us (apparently a *lot* of us) do.  

f) If you've never gotten to the end of a film and felt the need to sit there and think about it for a bit... that's... really sad.

g) Weirdly, the thing that set me off was *Blue Thunder*.  I loved this movie as a kid, loved the shitty electronic score... so when I got the end I'm like ""oh yeah, there's this extendo version of the theme which was pretty sweet"" and then I get there and BOOM it's like NO MUSIC ONLY TRAILER.  And it made me thought of other times when I wanted to just relax and think about what I'd seen, and popped.  Er, half-popped.

movies,eckx4x,'Cats' - Review Thread,"Review embargo just lifted for *Cats*. Apparently it's purr-ty bad. This is getting **absolutely destroyed** by critics. Some of these reviews are legit ""worst of the year"" contenders. Lots of savage (and hilarious) 1/10 or 2/10 reviews. This movie just went from Oscar-hopeful to Razzies-favorite. It's a total trainwreck.

On the bright side, there will at least be some award-winning puns/memes to come out of this. Looks like the trailer backlash was warranted after all. 

**Rotten Tomatoes Score**: [19% - 115 Reviews - 3.75 Average Score](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cats_2019)

> Andrew Lloyd Webber’s feline fantasy musical becomes a garish hairball. It’s hard to “ruin” Webber’s already strange musical, but Tom Hooper’s wrongheaded attempt certainly tries. Tom Hooper’s jarring fever dream of a spectacle is like something that escaped from Dr. Moreau’s creature laboratory instead of a poet’s and a composer’s feline (uni)verse, an un-catty valley hybrid of physical and digital that unsettles and crashes way more often than it enchants. 

[Bleeding Cool](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/12/18/cats-review-a-bad-musical-adapted-into-a-worse-movie/)

[Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review-tom-hoopers-cats-is-a-chaotic-tribute-to-a-dire-cultural-artifact/)

> This adaptation gets straight to the heart of the material, which is basically two hours of stray cats introducing themselves.

[Rendy Reviews](https://www.rendyreviews.com/movies//cats-review)

> On a scale of one to Zemeckis, Hooper's Cats boldly goes beyond the uncanny valley and creates a tier of its own.

Screen Junkies

> A spectacular disaster...This movie feels like a prank but I don't know on whom.

[The Jam Report](https://thejamreport.com/2019/12/19/review-cats-is-the-most-inexplicably-bizarre-film-of-the-year/)

[RTE Ireland](https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/movie-reviews/2019/1218/1101984-cats-is-a-twee-and-irksome-furrago-of-a-movie/)

> First off, full disclosure - I am not a cat person. Second off - after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.

movies,wq5308,"""Passengers"" with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt is one of the most transparently ""wish fulfillment"" movies I've seen","It's borderline Wattpad material. 

Have you ever fantasized about being stuck on an island with Jennifer Lawrence but don't want to worry about pesky little things like scavenging for food and supplies or basic survival? Well, say no more, because here you'll be trapped in an automated, luxurious space cruise with Jennifer Lawrence. Your every need will be met by helpful, sassy British bartenders and you'll live out your days in languorous comfort.

You won't have to worry about any competition for J-Law's attention, of course, because everyone else in the cruise will be conveniently asleep in their cryo chambers. Except for the hottest woman, whom you woke up in a moment of ~~horniness~~ weakness that the movie will bend over backwards to justify (more on that later). 

But worry not, you'll get to keep your status as a relatable, salt-of-the-earth, blue collar everyday guy and still partake of the ship's luxurious priviliges because J-Law will use *her* VIP bracelet to procure the best food and accommodations for you, cheap ticket holder. Whew! That was close!

And then, eventually, of course, J-Law will find out you woke her up and basically doomed her to a slow death with nobody else but you by her side and prevented her from fulfilling her life-long dream of being the first journalist to set foot on humanity's newly-colonized planet. BUT, before she can get *too* angry about a simple faux pas like that, Laurence Fishburne will make a timely appearance and with his Old Man Wisdom and in his dying breath (we don't want ol' Laurence staying for too long and stealing your girl, right?), he will tell J-Law to forgive you because you need to stay together, for...reasons, even though he doesn't know any of you.

And if that wasn't enough to make J-Law forget you murdered her and ruined her life, there's a sudden mechanical problem that threatens the lives of everyone onboard and only you with your humble, mechanical prowess can fix it, heroically risking your life in the process. 

But you'll survive of course, and you'll save the day so hard that J-Law will not only forgive you but she'll fall in love with you so completely that she'll refuse to use the surplus cryo chamber and instead choose to spend the rest of her life wandering around an empty ship with you, because women don't need those silly professional goals, they just need a man to make them happy.

movies,kxb3f6,The transformation of Rambo from broken veteran to unstoppable killing machine is a real cultural loss.,"There really isn’t a more idiotic devolution of a character in modern popular culture than that of Rambo. If you haven’t seen the first film, First Blood, it’s a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn’t a psychotic nationalist, he’s a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He’s a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It’s not even an action film, it’s a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn’t Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were.

Then, in the second film, we get a neck shattering 180 into full on Ronald Reagan revisionism of the war in Vietnam. Rambo 2 perpetuates several popular and resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war and that the war would have been won by Americans of only we (the American people) had allowed them to win.

To say Rambo 2 is cultural vandalism would be putting it mildly. It’s a cinematic tragedy. They took a poignant anti war film and made it into a jingoistic Cold War fantasy.",46132,2555,1610647710.0,Discussion,0.88,True,False,HasSomeSelfEsteem,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kxb3f6/the_transformation_of_rambo_from_broken_veteran/,top,medium
