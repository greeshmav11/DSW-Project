gaming,1lul1cn,does there exist a game with this specific gameplay loop?,"hi. i'm curious whether there is a game like this: an adventure / action / rpg game where you explore the world, gathering resources along the way, which then goes into a management sim where you spend the resources to build a city or home base here are some examples of games i've played that come close to this idea but don't quite fit: - little king's story - suikoden - harvestella - ys 8 lacrimosa of dana - zelda breath of the wild (tarrey town sidequest) - xenoblade chronicles (colony 6 sidequest) - romancing saga 2 revenge of the seven (avalon city) however, all of these games aren't quite it - it's not so much a town-building game as it is just a town upgrading system. you don't tend to be able to choose where each new building goes, it just happens in a linear sequence. when you ""max out"" the town upgrades, the final town will look exactly the same as a maxed-out town of every other player on every other playthrough. so there isn't much freedom of expression in the town building. here are some games that come even closer to the idea: - dragon quest builders / builders 2 it isn't so much a management sim as it is a minecraft style block-by-block building game. the game does recognise specific rooms depending on which objects you place in them, though, which is fun. however the issue comes with the fact that, in these games, your home base is only recognised within a tiny 32x32 square of land, and anything you build outside of that ""doesn't count"". there does exist the larger sandbox mode, but there isn't much sim gameplay there, it's mostly a pure sandbox at that point. - actraiser this game _does_ feature both action levels and sim levels, however the two don't really interact with each other that much. the only resource you gain in the action levels is score, which has a vague effect on your eventual maximum population in the sim levels, but the correlation isn't really obvious. plus you can't replay the action levels, so there isn't really a ""gameplay loop"" of gathering -> building -> gathering etc. the sim system in actraiser is extremely basic - even though you get to ""decide"" which direction your town builds in, there really isn't all that much choice at the end of the day - you will want to max out the town by just telling them to build on all available tiles... and, again, all players' endgame towns will end up looking identical to each other. it doesn't quite have the depth i'm looking for. does anyone have any ideas for other games that might have this kind of gameplay i'm looking for?",0,53,None,0.36,True,False,BenjyMLewis,new,low,10,self_post

gaming,1lu3534,could we also get some huge initiative about games being released in a poor state?,"with all the attention stop killing games is getting i feel like this would also be a good time to bring up games being released in a “half-assed” state. we’ve seen constantly complaints over the years, from social media to literal memes about crysis. it’s beyond frustrating that we live in a world where games have been poorly optimized and now gpu manufactures created a bandaid fix with frame generation which is exactly what most recent dilemma is monster hunter wilds with the devs solved the issue by turning this on as a solution. i’m not an organizer for something like his but i’d love to be apart of an organization that finally gets the ball rolling on this topic instead of just meming about it and “dealing with it”. what would the end result of this look like? well clearly games not in a piss poor state upon release for starters, but also that large distributors of games like ms, sony, nintendo, valve and yes even sites like greenmangaming should allow customers to request a refund if the game is in a broken state upon release that goes beyond the 2 hours. while i understand for smaller devs there needs to be some similar but not as harsh rules, this is mainly targeted at larger studios. we all know 2 hours is not enough time to really try a game. on average you’re just getting past the tutorial and gathering a baseline of how the game works. this also would help with gamers not having to fork over their hard earned money on extremely expensive and limited stock of hardware just to play these games at a “decent” state. we should be living in a world now with the advancements in tech where in order for me to play a aaa game at 60-90fps doesn’t require a current top of the line gpu from any manufacture. we shouldn’t have to wait for a nintendo switch 2 to finally play original switch titles at their expected performance. i would really like to hear from the community what suggestions collectively we could do to start this. i’d like an actual conversation with some sort of ground work. the “vote with your wallet” doesn’t exactly work. it has helped a small handful of times in the last and devs have fixed their games later on, but this shouldn’t even have to be the norm we live in today. edit: amazing the only responses are basically just ""don't buy day 1/pre-order"" which misses the point. either you're way to young to remember a time where games launched and didn't need months and months of optimization time post release (if ever) or you're being ignorant.",0,29,None,0.4,True,False,halolordkiller3,new,low,19,self_post

gaming,1lqkbd8,pac-man world 2 (#2),"i just finished pac-man world 2, and as someone who enjoys classic platformers, i was pleasantly surprised by how charming and well-made this game still feels, especially for a franchise that originally started in 2d arcade form. from the very first level, it’s clear that this is a big step up from the original pac-man world, with tighter controls, more colorful and varied environments, and a level design that focuses more on action and movement. each world has its own visual and musical identity, from lush forests and underwater caves to icy peaks and spooky valleys, and the game does a good job introducing new mechanics like ice sliding, swimming, or wall jumping to keep things fresh. pac-man’s movement feels snappy and satisfying, and abilities like the butt bounce and the rev roll are fun to use, adding a nice layer of personality to the platforming. the rev roll in particular gives the gameplay a sense of speed and momentum that helps distinguish it from other mascot platformers of the era. that said, not everything has aged perfectly. the camera can be clunky, especially in tight spaces or underwater sections where it doesn’t always follow the action well, leading to some frustrating deaths. later levels sometimes rely too much on trial and error, with sudden falls and bottomless pits that feel more cheap than challenging. the collectible system can be addictive if you’re a completionist, but also annoying if you realize you missed a fruit at the start of a long level and need to replay the whole thing. despite these issues, the game has a lot of charm. the soundtrack is catchy, the boss battles have a simple arcade-style fun, and including the original pac-man game as an unlockable extra is a great nod to the series’ roots. overall, pac-man world 2 is a colorful and underrated 3d platformer that may show its age at times, but still delivers a fun and memorable experience with a lot of heart.",10,4,None,0.59,False,False,Kaos989,new,low,8,image

gaming,1lq10za,trying to understand skg: why shouldn't a creator of an online game have the right to shut down fully their own creation?,"if i'm understanding the skg initiative correctly, say i wanted to make an online game, and provide access to this game via a client the user can subscribe to for some monthly fee. this user is also given the opportunity to know that this game may shut down fully (fully meaning they wouldn't have to do any end of life support, wouldn't have to release the server files, etc) for any reason (or maybe more accurately after some final month to ensure their last fee wasn't completely wasted) before any point of purchase of their subscription, i wouldn't be able to do this? specifically completely shut down my own game, and not have to release any part of it afterwards. or maybe this still would be allowed and i'm misunderstanding something, but anyway... with all that said, it seems like many people have mention a few things. 1. ""why would someone ever want their own work destroyed?"" - to that, i don't really see why someone else's desire or reason to do whatever they want to their own work should be questioned, or at most stopped. it's their work, if they currently own it / have possession of it, etc, by all means, let them do whatever they want to it. 2. ""what if someone came into your home to destroy your tv, book, painting, etc?"" - this analogy doesn't work with an online game, or more accurately, the permission to access information that lives on a server from your client. i can understand yeah, if you bought something fully (as with an mmo you aren't purchasing the entire full stack environment) you now own that thing, and tough luck for the creator to try and do anything about it. 3. ""why wouldn't they just be able to release the game's server data, they're not using it anymore, etc? - similar to point 1, they don't have to, and there might be good reason, say some game rework, wanting to make something for a limited time only, etc. sure, it would be nice to release everything, as it would continue on whatever they've made and people could continue to play something they enjoy, but again, it's something they shouldn't be enforced to do, in any manner. (also note: in some cases server code might be source code itself, as with some of my online games, skg has mentioned source code wouldn't need to be released, and i could wrap code in some obfuscation, or some other method, but i would disagree that their initiative should dictate how i write my server code, which leads back to what their initiative kind of boils down to anyway...) keep in mind i don't even live in the region where this is being proposed, i'm just trying to get a better understanding of everything. and i'm not trying to ""attack"" or just discredit the skg movement as i would also like every single game to be preserved. i love games and have spent probably too much of my life playing them. but i run into this issue in my head about if some creator wanted to shut down access to their game, who am i to be able to do anything about it? i'm not entitled to their ip, and what money i've spent on it doesn't cover any ownership over what was running on the server. sure, maybe this is exactly what skg is trying to do, and i would have to disagree with it due to removing the ability of choice for some creator who may just want their creations to be shut down for whatever reason they may have.",0,49,None,0.24,True,False,Lunarcomplex,new,low,16,self_post

gaming,1lpzvr5,why has there been such a massive amount of misinformation around the switch 2?,"i know this is r/gaming so this is probably going to be giga downvoted and i’m gonna be accused of bootlicking the billion dollar corporation or whatever, but i really can’t wrap my head around how there’s been so much easily disprovable misinformation around the switch 2 and i understand, nintendo does a lot of questionable things like being debatably too protective of their ip and things of that nature, but people have legitimately just been making things up or lying to make it seem worse but like 1. “$80 games are the standard now” just not true. this might be subject to change, so we’ll say this is the weakest point, but at the time of writing, it’s literally only mario kart. and whether you agree or disagree, mario kart world is a game people are going to be playing for a decade if the last game is any indicator. if there’s any game that could even theoretically justify a higher price for the amount of value you’re going to get from it over time, mario kart is certainly one of the few. any of the “$80” switch 2 editions of games like tears of the kingdom and kirby are effectively just a $70 and $60 game with a $10 and $20 dlc, and donkey kong is $70. we can criticize not making the base price of the older games lower so that a $10 or $20 dlc doesn’t bring it up to $80, but that’s different from $80 being “standard”. 2. “physical games are more expensive than digital” there is no evidence to suggest that this is true in any sort of widespread capacity. the only source to this claim was a single website that i haven’t even seen any follow-ups on, but even on the tiny chance that it is true, it’s just for that singular region and not something new 3. “nintendo changed their eula so they can brick your console for no reason whenever they want”. for one, this is language that is similar across all console manufacturers from the moment consoles were consistently connected to the internet all the way back to the wii/ps3 era. this is not a new nor a uniquely nintendo concept. secondly, they do not brick your console, they restrict it from accessing any online features is they detect or suspect things like piracy. again, this is not new, console manufacturers of all brands have been doing this for years. one of the first things you would hear back in the day if you wanted to mod a 3ds was “make sure you do not connect to the internet on the modded console” for exactly this reason. you can still play your physical games just fine (which leads to the next point), the console is far from “bricked” 4. “physical games are dead all the games are basically just codes in boxes”. this is entirely on third parties, and, once again also not new or unique to nintendo. the newest doom, for example, is not fully on disc and requires an internet download. and even then, at the time of writing, all first party nintendo games and nintendo switch 2 editions of older first party games are all fully on cart with all content, no internet needed. cyberpunk on switch 2 is also fully on cart, demonstrating that it is possible and this is a conscious decision from developers. i’ve heard that the larger carts are a bit more expensive to produce, but, just like everyone constantly says about nintendo, these are almost all multibillion dollar corporations and publishers, they can afford to print the more expensive carts. until a first party nintendo game is released as a game key-card, this is not a complaint to leverage at nintendo specifically and i’m sure there might be a few more i’m not remembering right now all of these are things that take like 5 seconds of googling or just using your eyes to see that they’re not true, but a month later i’m still seeing tons of people peddling these myths as if they’re unquestionable fact. some of it is definitely the fault of the gaming publications reporting dubious unsubstantiated claims, not doing their due diligence by fact checking before publishing, but that’s only up to a point. eventually it’s on us to do our own research and confirm information",0,70,None,0.41,True,False,brando-boy,new,low,16,self_post

gaming,1lopelh,what are your experiences trying to get non-gamers into gaming?,"hey everyone, in the past i'd tried on multiple occasions to get my parents into games, and it resulted in a lot of failed attempts but every now and then i still get the urge to try again with the logic that maybe i just hadn't been picking games that'd be suitable to their sensibilities. these are some examples of my mom's experiences: **persona 4 golden** \- right off the bat it probably was not the best idea to start off with a jrpg, as on top of how deep mechanics can get, she couldn't fathom how a video game could be 70+ hours long. she liked the country town setting but quickly got bored by the long intro segment and i don't think she could really take it all that seriously because of the anime aesthetic. at the time i just wanted to share something i'd enjoyed with her, but i'm actually glad she didn't continue because of the ""fanservice-y"" stuff in the game and one of the dungeons for>!a 15yr old character being a literal strip club...!< **breath of the wild** \- i thought the sort of ""sandbox"" aspect of it would lend itself well to someone getting acclimated, but again she quickly got bored, this time's reasoning being that having so much freedom and only having vague reminders of what she ""should"" be doing instead of having more straightforward progression made it feel like her exploration and actions didn't really mean anything, so she gave up within the hour. interesting how what many consider the game's biggest strength was a sour spot for someone not very familiar with the medium. **mario kart 8 deluxe** \- i figured she'd like this one for the multiplayer aspect, but she couldn't get a good grip on the controls and it requiring constant action from the player was just a bit too much for her. although she kept bumping into walls she didn't want the handicaps like smart steering on either, so we moved onto smash ultimate. **smash ultimate** \- i'm surprised that she actually enjoyed her time with this one. compared to mario kart i'd always considered smash the much more complex of the two but she seemed to get the gist pretty quickly, and despite not knowing who a good chunk of the roster was she liked how many characters there were to choose from because it never made matches feel stale. **undertale** \- despite also being an rpg, compared to a traditional one i felt it was lighter on the mechanics side and i figured she'd at least find some charm in the characters and writing. this one had a bit more going on so i'll bullet it: \- the simplistic graphics and a lack of voice acting for all that text seemed to be an innate barrier that made it hard for her to get immersed. \- she never had a great sense of direction in the ruins, so she'd often exit a room only to walk right back into it thinking she was entering a new one and be confused why she wasn't making progress. \- the battle system confused her, as she didn't see much point to adding extra steps by using the act commands and sparing when she could just kill the enemies, and also wasn't great at dodging enemy attacks \- because she kept getting lost, she'd naturally trigger a lot of random encounters which frustrated her because she didn't understand why the same enemies she had ""beaten already"" kept appearing i remember her seeing sans and papyrus, so we made it out of the ruins but i don't remember if i might've helped her or took over at some point because she got too annoyed. regardless, she didn't seem to want to play again. but anyways, this might've been a loaded read, but feel free to share your own experiences or advice as well!",0,47,None,0.4,True,False,OneMirrionYen,new,low,1,self_post

gaming,1lmmdjb,genre bending,"the mario franchise is an example of a franchise that crosses over to numerous gaming genres frequently- from racing, to platforming, to sports and beyond. but, mario is an easy franchise to adapt to multiple genres due to the very light hearted and imaginative nature of the games. what do you think would be a good franchise to crossover to different genres, in a way that actually makes sense and fits the story/universe to some extent? one example of mine would be a resident evil fighting game. the story would be that the main characters are a team of specialists investigating more reports of t-virus shenanigans in another remote area of the planet. they get captured, and learn that a secretive cult is using heavily modified strains of the virus to enhance physical abilities of humans, to various degrees of effect and success. not trying to create total abominations, but merely enhance the “human experience”. they test their “super soldiers” in what is essentially cage fighting, and now that they’ve gotten their hands on a crew of highly trained and skilled bio-terror specialists, they can *really* put their creations to the test. what results is a somewhat traditional side-view fighting game, but heavily dosed with story and cinematics. you have to try to survive the fights with your crew of 8, and you get different endings depending on how many of your crew are left by the end. of course, at some point things go off the rails and instead of just a cage fight, there will be a side-scrolling escape segment where you use everything you’ve learned so far to escape the facility, quick-swapping between whatever crew members remain alive to fight through generic goons as enhanced warriors alike. i don’t know. maybe this is stupid as hell but i feel like re is a good franchise to expand into different genres. what are some of your ideas?",0,5,None,0.15,True,False,Left4DayZGone,new,low,13,self_post

gaming,1ljlby8,why i love elden ring.,"to celebrate shadow of the erdtree's anniversary, i spent a few days writing this lengthy paper that explores elden ring from philosophical, psychological, sociological, and feminist perspectives. if you've ever wanted to see elden ring described in these perspectives, this post is for you. references to in-game dialogue, item descriptions, and academic work are included. i hope you enjoy reading it as much as i enjoyed writing it. elden ring (2022) is my favourite game of all time, and shadow of the erdtree (2024) is my favourite dlc of all time. while many emphasize the combat and vast open world, my love for elden ring centres on its lore, psychological depth, philosophical underpinnings, and sociological structures. to me, elden ring is not merely a game but a platform for examining complex psychological, philosophical, and sociological issues. **philosophy: order, chaos, and the search for meaning** the story of elden ring revolves around the eponymous elden ring and its shattering. more than a mere metaphor, the elden ring is a physical manifestation of cosmic law and order. marika's fracturing of the ring represents an act of deconstruction that destabilizes the lands between. the conflict among her demigod children showcases how any governing system, no matter how perfect its proponents believe it to be, is influenced by subjective interpretations and conflicts of interest. the shattering of the elden ring can thus be seen as a symbol for the ever-increasing tension between the desire for stability and structure and the chaotic, transformative forces beneath the surface. miquella adds a crucial layer to this dynamic, as the age of compassion, where everyone is welcome and not discriminated against \[1\], starkly contrasts the rigid status quo of the golden order \[2, 3\] and the destructive frenzied flame. in opposition to miquella's vision, the frenzied flame offers a nihilistic outlook: a desire to return to primordial existence through universal immolation to end the suffering, chaos, and despair that inhabit the lands between \[4\]. such an approach of absolute destruction raises questions about this response to profound despair, while ranni's age of stars raises questions about reforming and reimagining fractured and broken worlds \[5\] throughout elden ring, many different groups have competing ideals that strongly harken back to nietzsche and the concept of will to power (deleuze, 2006). this is not merely about brute force; it is the fundamental drive to overcome, create, and define values within the world. the golden order, the frenzied flame, ranni, and miquella each represent a unique view on what the proper ""order"" in the world should look like, and each embodies a distinct manifestation of this will. the golden order asserts its dominance mainly by physical force, declaring its tenets universal law while suppressing dissenters, their beliefs, and their history (nietzsche, 2006). the frenzied flame, by contrast, seeks to burn everything back into a primordial state. the tarnished, an outcast rescued and guided by grace, explores this broken world. however, this guidance does not diminish player agency; instead, it frames it, as the tarnished retains complete autonomy over their actions, including which age to usher in. the lands between is filled with decay, rotting corpses, unburied horrors, and an oppressive past, all of which force the player to find meaning in what is initially seen as a meaningless world devoid of truth. in this world, old truths have shattered, and purpose is absent. the tarnished's choice to create or reject a new order echoes the work of jean-paul sartre and his concept of radical freedom (sartre, 2007). sartre suggested that humans are fundamentally free, born without a predestined purpose; we can say, think, feel, and do whatever we desire. for him, existence precedes essence; our identity and what we take meaning in are not predetermined or given to us; we make them via our choices. this lack of a predestined path shows that humans are solely responsible for their choices, not as punishment, but as a recognition that there is no such thing as absolute right or wrong, and no escape from choice; even choosing not to choose is a choice. because there is no inherent right or wrong, the individual becomes the source of their values, not the external world. such freedom, of course, carries with it a heavy burden, as each choice carries an intense weight. sartre (2007) identified three emotional consequences of this absolute freedom: anguish, where anxiety arises from having such freedom and responsibility; forlornness, the isolation that comes with these choices, as we are the meaning-makers; and despair, the fact that the only actions we can rely on are our own, as we lack control over external events and the actions of others. as a largely blank slate for the player, the tarnished perfectly embodies this existential journey, as the player's choices define their essence. the tarnished can themselves be viewed through a philosophical lens. through insurmountable odds, seemingly endless challenges, and making choices in a meaningless world, the tarnished can represent the absurd hero (camus, 1991), who finds dignity and purpose in rebellion against meaninglessness. the tarnished's existence and their choices as they persevere against all odds are an act of defiance against the notion of meaninglessness. the game also explores the ethics of power and choice. each ending the player can choose is not merely an option for a trophy; it represents an ethical stance on what should happen to the lands between and can encourage the player to consider their choice. the age of fracture mends the elden ring, and the golden order remains steadfast, as does the status quo. in contrast, the frenzied flame offers absolute destruction. however, its moral standing is ambiguous: is it truly nihilistic, or is it an act of mercy intended to end a cycle of profound suffering? these questions and the possible endings challenge players to confront their moral compass. queen marika's removal of the rune of death \[6\] raises specific questions. if existence is constant and devoid of death, what worth can be ascribed to life, experience, and suffering? the constant respawning of weaker foes underscores the notion that immortality, when devoid of purpose and evolution, can be a curse rather than a blessing, leading to stagnation, decay, and a loss of meaning in existence itself. finally, the outer gods introduce the nature of divinity. powers such as the god of rot and the formless mother often influence and manipulate those in the lands between \[7\], rendering them pawns in a game they do not understand, with rules and stakes they cannot even begin to recognize. the outer gods bring about questions of free will, determinism, and the agency one has when faced with divine wills. elden ring is about cycles, reprisals, decay, and potential rebirth. the golden order perpetuates a cycle of dominance that resists change. in contrast, ranni's age of stars signifies a profound yearning for rupture, change, and an end to this stagnant cycle, a breaking from the cycle of suffering. the tarnished's choice is personal and represents whether the world will be trapped in an endless cycle or reborn. **psychology: scars of trauma and the grip of obsession** the lands between is a traumatized space; the shattering represents not merely an event in time, but an active, open wound: an ongoing trauma that refuses to heal, deeply scarring the land (van der kolk, 2014). players can see the warfare and sense immense decay as the land continually relives its trauma, evoking the psychological aftermath over the lands. likewise, the land of shadow can be seen as a repressed collective trauma due to marika casting a veil over it, effectively causing it to be forgotten, mirroring how societies can repress painful memories to cope with overwhelming events. elden ring features numerous groups bound by obsessive fanaticism and a unique response to a broken world. nowhere is this more apparent than within the golden order, with their cognitive rigidity and confirmation bias, where belief systems become exclusionary and resistant to differing views on truth. furthermore, many within the order engage in cognitive dissonance (festinger, 1957), staunchly adhering to the order's decaying tenets and refusing to question how such a perfect order could have made the world so broken. lineage, parental actions, expectations, and the confronting failures of previous generations also shape the lives of many characters. miquella, for instance, strives to create an age of compassion, seeking to transcend the golden order's limitations and build a perfect system for those rejected by the erdtree and to atone for the harm of his mother \[8\]. ranni, who was supposed to be the next carian queen, renounces her role as future queen \[9\] in favour of the age of stars, actively defining her destiny apart from her inherited expectations. elden ring also employs jungian archetypes extensively (jung, 1968a; 1968b). marika, for example, embodies the great mother and the shadow as she shattered the elden ring. radagon, in contrast, may serve as a fragmented aspect of the self. the erdtree can represent a world tree, a symbol of totality and connection. understanding such symbols can enhance the depth of understanding of elden ring and showcase universal collective unconscious patterns within the game (bean, 2023). elden ring also showcases how hubris and ambition can lead to ruin. marika's children are driven to claim the elden ring for themselves. however, this leads to a ceaseless war characterized by madness and horrible transformations (physical, mental, and emotional), with radahn being perhaps the most well-known casualty as the scarlet rot afflicted him and drove him to madness \[10\]. morgott is a tragic victim, fanatically devoted to an order that rejected him \[11\]. **sociology: power dynamics, hierarchy, control, and feminism** elden ring presents a complex interplay of power dynamics, religious hegemony, and social stratification with a distinct social hierarchy. marika and her children are at the apex, while beings such as the omens are at the bottom. structurally, this hierarchy is also evident. compare the beautiful capital city of leyndell with the numerous dilapidated villages scattered throughout, along with the wretched underground beneath the capital; the game emphasizes heavy social exclusion based on unchosen characteristics. for example, omens, when born, either have their horns removed as infants, a process that many do not survive \[12\] or are confined deep underground \[13\]. the omens undergo a form of eugenics based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority. ostracization and persecution are perhaps nowhere better exemplified than in those who live in death; the golden order considers their entire existence an affront to the order's ideology of life, death, and rebirth \[14\], showing that those who defy prevailing ideological norms will be subject to active persecution and social ostracism. the golden order is not merely a religious doctrine to be passively followed; it is also a force that has asserted its dominance all across the land through conquest and assimilation. the order and its beliefs are rigid and unwilling to tolerate differing faiths and cultures to preserve and control what they view as accurate. examples of these conquests and assimilations include the fire giants, whom the order viewed as a threat \[15\] and, as a final act of humiliation, forced one last fire giant to guard the flame that could burn the erdtree \[16\]. in a more subtle form of cultural assimilation, the golden order had radagon wed rennala, ending the liurnian war through marriage rather than destruction \[17, 18\]. the theories of michel foucault (1990, 1995) can also be applied to elden ring's concept of power, specifically how it intertwines with knowledge and discourse. the golden order does not simply maintain control via military might; it controls what is considered truth and history, normalizing certain behaviours while forbidding and punishing others. again, turning to the omens, who were harmed and segregated based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority, reflects foucault's ideas on how power structures create and enforce norms via exclusion and discipline, and how those in power use more than force to bend and shape minds and bodies by shaping the very reality of what is acceptable and what is not. elden ring also has a strong focus on determinism vs. free will. framing events as predetermined and predestined might seem to dissuade action. however, the player's choices to defy or fulfil these prophecies comment on an individual's ability to break from (or continue) societal expectations (bogost, 2007; rendle & pasternack, 2025). the game's narrative often presents prophecies, yet the agency given to the tarnished allows for the subversion or affirmation of these preordained paths, making the player's interaction with destiny a key theme. beyond the omens (discussed extensively), the game shows other systematic subjugation with the albinaurics, who were created by human hands \[19\] and persecuted by the knights of the cuckoos for their defiled blood \[20\]. albinaurics mirror historical patterns of social subjection based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority and are used only for their utility (du bois, 1994; marx & engels, 2002). even the last fire giant's forced humiliation is an act of prolonged psychological and social subjugation from the golden order. finally, the shattering left the lands between in a stagnant, violent cycle with seemingly no end. even after the death of certain demigods, many of their forces remain, and the repercussions, abetted by the unburied dead and decaying lands, are omnipresent. such a portrayal represents a view of the sociological aftermath of systemic conflict. even after authorities collapse, societies can become trapped in cycles of conflict and decay, and the tarnished can often find themselves as mere pawns, mirroring the fact that so many people can become engaged in conflict with profound and ambiguous consequences. **feminism in elden ring** like many other fromsoft games, elden ring is rich in feminist interpretations, featuring many excellent and strong female characters (or female-presenting characters) who wield tremendous power and significance. queen marika herself is the central figure in elden ring. while strong, she also possesses a degree of suffering and entrapment \[21\]. ranni the witch actively rejects her role and seeks to establish a new order free from the influence of the outer gods. her desire for autonomy and self-determination is central to much feminist literature. malenia, blade of miquella, is an incredible warrior whose prowess with a blade is unmatched \[22\], even with her scarlet rot; this serves as a testament to her resilience and determination. melina is another central character who serves as a guide for the player. initially seeking to make it to the erdtree to understand the purpose given to her by her mother \[23\], melina eventually gains agency and volition in forging her own path, refusing the purpose her mother gave her \[24, 25\]. even miquella, another empyrean, is presented with a feminine appearance and manner. his perpetually young \[26\] and feminine form starkly contrasts with the rugged, imposing physiques of the other male demigods, such as godfrey, godrick, and especially radahn. his youthful, feminine appearance is complemented by his gentle demeanour and goal of creating an age based on compassion and inclusion rather than using brute force. miquella's quest contrasts traditional, often aggressive displays of power by men, showcasing that influence in the lands between is not simply tied to conventional masculinity and acts of violence and war. elden ring features matrilineal societies: women hold significant power as gods, queens, leaders, and empyreans, and leaders (e.g., queen marika, rennala, queen of the full moon, lunar princess ranni, gloam-eyed queen, malenia, blade of miquella, hornsent grandam). one striking observation is that all the candidates for godhood were either female (ranni, malenia, marika, gloam-eyed queen) or appeared as feminine in appearance and mannerisms (miquella, who is a stark contrast to every other male demigod). to me, this suggests a fundamental connection between femininity and divine power. the stories of marika, ranni, melina, and miquella touch upon themes of autonomy and the fight against the predetermined. for example, ranni sheds her body to escape her fate, and melina, having finally found her purpose, lights herself aflame in an act of agency. elden ring may not be overtly ""in your face"" with feminism like other games, but there is plenty here for rich feminist interpretations. the game showcases a world with powerful women and feminine characters central to the story, whose struggles revolve around agency, fighting against external control, and challenging destiny. elden ring is a work of art in every sense of the word. it is a rich and fertile ground for academics to explore complex themes of philosophy (such as discussing order, chaos, meaning, radical freedom and the will to stop various warring factions while creating meaning from the meaningless), psychology (how the world of elden ring is an open-world deeply scarred by past and ongoing trauma as the many inhabitants contend with obsession, cognitive dissonance, and generational burdens all while embodying various archetypes that resonate with the collective unconscious of the world), and sociology (as it presents a world filled with power dynamics, social stratification, and the torment of marginalized groups, offering an example of foucauldian power structures and the persistent cycles of conflict and control). finally, the game stands out for its strong feminist undertones as it presents strong female and feminine-presenting characters who actively (rather than passively) defy traditional tropes and champion themes of agency, autonomy, and self-determination. as i said at the start, elden ring is my favourite game of all time, and the shadow of the erdtree dlc is my favourite dlc of all time; each is a work of art that asks the player to deeply explore a narrative that challenges preconceived notions and beliefs while providing insight into the human condition and ethical thought. **in game lore:** \[1\] miquella's unused dialogue: ""i hereby swear... to every living being, and every living soul... now comes the age of our eden... a thousand-year voyage guided by compassion... beginning here, love encompasses all... no living thing will be denied, no deed censured... if you have known sin, if you grieve for this world, i am ready. to embrace the whole of it..."" miquella | elden ring wiki: \[2\] corhyn: ""the golden order is founded on the principle that marika is the one true god."" golden order | elden ring wiki | fandom \[3\] enia: ""now, seek the erdtree, and an audience with queen marika. to become elden lord, and restore the golden order."" golden order | elden ring wiki | fandom \[4\] merchant kalé's unused dialogue: ""o three fingers, throw wide the door. please, bestow unto me the yellow flame of chaos. a frenzied flame to melt away the curses, suffering and despair. and the order, entire. may chaos take the world."" frenzied flame | elden ring wiki | fandom \[5\] ranni’s japanese dialogue: “about my order, my order will not be of gold, but of the stars and moon, and chill night. i want to keep it far away from this land. even if life and souls are one with the order, it could be kept far away. if it was not possible to clearly see, feel, believe in, or touch the order, that would be better. that is why i will leave this place, along with the order."" elden ring: ranni's age of stars ending mistranslations explained \[6\] enia: ""the rune of death goes by two names;

gaming,1ljbfpy,finding beauty in terror: eroguro in silent hill f.,"silent hill f is the game i am most excited for this year; i even bought the deluxe edition for $27 because i saved up ps stars points for nearly two years just for this game. since the initial trailer, i have been fixated on the concept of eroguro and its connection to the game. having been in post-secondary for the last eight years, i wrote a small academic paper on the connection between eroguro and silent hill f. i hope you love reading it as much as i loved writing it. **blossoming horror: the** ***eroguro*** **influence in** ***silent hill f*** the serene japanese village of ebisugaoka in *silent hill f* undergoes a disturbing transformation into blossoming horror, marking a profound and fascinating departure for the acclaimed franchise. unveiled in 2022, *silent hill f* quickly garnered significant attention from fans due to its notable shift from the traditional american midwest setting to 1960s rural japan. the game’s debut trailer presented a striking blend of rustic aesthetics intertwined with profound horrors, indicating a marked departure from an industrial american ideal. instead, the game favours a framework heavily rooted in *eroguro*. the presence of parasitic flora and fauna, the disintegration of a young schoolgirl's innocence, and the unsettling juxtaposition of beauty with decay are pivotal. the game employs an *eroguro* framework to forge a psychologically distinct horror experience, aiming to instill fear in players by delving into the beauty within the grotesque. **a shift in aesthetic and narrative** the *silent hill* franchise is characteristically defined by elements like rust, fog, industrial decay, and monsters influenced by freudian concepts. these elements are evident from the dilapidated titular town in *silent hill* to the confined apartment of *silent hill 4: the room*. however, *silent hill f* represents a notable departure in its narrative and aesthetic framework. it transitions from an industrial context to a rural japanese village, introducing monsters embodying a paradoxical blend of beauty and horror. this shift transcends mere visual changes; it signals a significant evolution in artistic direction. this evolution is deeply rooted in the influences of *eroguro*. silverberg (2007) states that *eroguro* constitutes a distinct genre within japanese art. to fully understand its applicability to the game, we must deconstruct its three core components: the erotic, the grotesque, and the nonsensical. individually, these themes define *eroguro's* unique characteristics. when combined, however, their true and unsettling nature takes shape. **the three pillars of** ***eroguro*** (1) ero (erotic) erotic transcends mere explicit sexuality; it encapsulates notions of sensuality, allure, beauty, and elements perceived as desirable. the trailers showcase a lush, beautiful, quiet life, initially displaying traditional japanese architecture among hills, rice fields, and village streets. such imagery often features young schoolgirls, who embody purity and tranquillity. however, by the end of the trailer, this lush beauty becomes nightmarish. plants bloom from humans, entangle bodies, and consume buildings. this transformation from something beautiful into something horrific mirrors the perversion of the desirable. what was once captivating becomes deeply unsettling, and the serene, picturesque village becomes ominous and distorted. (2) guro (grotesque) the grotesque does not solely denote gore and violence. instead, it signifies deformations, disturbances, and unsettling perversions of form and function. it evokes a sense of inherent wrongness or corruption that starkly contrasts with what one might typically consider beautiful, ordinary, or innocent. we easily see this element in the monsters, especially the flower girl from the first trailer. (3) nonsense nonsense pertains to surrealism, absurdity, and illogical constructs often accompanying the genre's disturbing essence. this element encompasses dreamlike states, abrupt transformations, and narratives that resist rational interpretation, engendering cognitive dissonance and discomfort. we can see this element in the village; the fog and flowers consuming ebisugaoka transform the small, quiet town into a surreal and illogical nightmare. **provocative themes and historical context** the confluence of these three elements interrogates various provocative themes. these include beauty, decay, attraction, repulsion, depravity, perversion, and the darker, often taboo dimensions of human desire. the resultant discomfort may emanate not solely from visual and thematic representations of bodies, but also from the disquietude of societal norms and psychological states. this art style reached its zenith during the taishō (1912-1926) and early shōwa eras (1927-1945). westernization, banning erotic art, warfare, industrialization, urban anxieties, such as class divide, social dislocation, economic instability, cultural clashes, and the subsequent american occupation characterized these periods (gordon, 2019). these multifaceted factors contributed to the emergence of artistic expressions that, despite restrictive circumstances, subverted traditional norms. while eroguro had its apex in the taishō and early shōwa era, it was suppressed during world war ii, only to reemerge after the war and influence entertainment like music and manga (mclelland, 2006). **deconstructing horror through** ***eroguro*** by employing an analytical lens focused on aesthetic and cultural transformations in this game through the prism of *eroguro*, we can adeptly deconstruct its distinctive approach to horror. this approach is intricately woven into the complex fabric of japanese cultural narratives, belief systems, historical contexts, and aesthetic principles. a fundamental principle within the *eroguro* genre is the juxtaposition of beauty and the grotesque. the horror manifests not merely through the monstrosities encountered by the player but rather in the degradation of what is conventionally perceived as beautiful. the trailers for this game effectively illustrate this principle. they present an idyllic village characterized by a picturesque landscape, traditional japanese architecture, and a young schoolgirl. however, this perception of beauty is systematically subverted as a red spider lily (*lycoris radiata*) begins to overrun the village. these flowers, known as higanbana, are frequently found near graveyards and are deeply associated with themes of death and the afterlife in buddhist contexts. the game employs these flowers as agents, initiating a transition from aesthetic beauty to the grotesque. a youthful girl blooming with these beautiful flowers appears in the inaugural trailer; she embodies a duality, being both a monster and an object of beauty. **symbolism and psychological depth** in japan, young girls serve as a compelling symbol within cultural discourse. they exist in various states that straddle the lines of innocence (a stark contrast to the horror engulfing the village) and burgeoning sexuality. this duality positions them as significant vessels for exploring themes such as corruption, guilt, shame, fear, and repression. the 1960s in japan were marked by profound upheaval (gordon, 2019), during which traditional values encountered the challenges posed by modern and increasingly liberal ideologies. consequently, young women faced intense societal pressure to adhere to ascribed roles. under the framework of *eroguro*, the horrors depicted can therefore be argued to be not merely external manifestations, but an internal horror projected outward. the game's writer, ryukishi07, powerfully demonstrates this tradition of using innocent-presenting characters to explore deep psychological turmoil. in his celebrated higurashi: when they cry series, he masterfully juxtaposes extreme trauma and brutal violence in a serene village setting with moé, an aesthetic built on attraction and affection for cute fictional characters (galbraith, 2014), which can include a desire to protect them (galbraith, 2009). ryukishi07’s involvement strongly suggests that the imagery of flowers in the game could symbolize trauma, guilt, repressed memories, forbidden desires, or the overwhelming social pressure to conform, ultimately blossoming into a grotesque beauty. such themes resonate with a fundamental aspect of *silent hill*: the psychological terrain made manifest, yet now interpreted through a distinctly japanese cultural and aesthetic lens articulated by *eroguro*. **a new frontier for horror** by integrating the concept of *eroguro*, *silent hill f* is positioned to offer an exceptionally unsettling horror experience. this experience creates unease and repulsion, inducing a perverse interpretation of beauty and transgressing various social taboos. the dynamic interplay between beauty and horror will likely make a distressing narrative as the environments and monsters fuse these elements. this fusion will create a strong sense of discomfort and psychological unease. critically, the *eroguro* framework allows the title to present the multifaceted concept of *eroguro* to a broader audience, showcasing that perhaps the most profound terror may be hidden in what we consider beautiful, allowing for a critical reassessment of what horror and beauty truly mean. **references** galbraith, p.

[ign - simon cardy]( \- 9 / 10 >the original death stranding held promise: a complex, often confusing, but never contrived first draft. a reflective journey across a lost america, it established a world and its rules with a flourish, even if i found it stumbled along the path. but in death stranding 2: on the beach, australia plays host to an expanded vision and is a more accomplished achievement in nearly every facet. it removes almost all of the friction that weighed down its rookie effort, delighting with a truly unpredictable story full of intrigue and malleable stealth-action playgrounds hidden in its vast, hauntingly beautiful version of australia. yes, at times, it is unapologetically weird – but that isn't what defines it. it's an inventive journey packed full of both shock and awe, the sort of bold work that deserves to be encouraged. no, it isn't perfect, but it's incredibly exciting and original, never once straying from the path less trodden, and i love it all the more for it. [cgmagazine - jordan biordi]( \- 9 / 10 >*death stranding 2: on the beach* consumed me. not simply because i can easily get absorbed in slow, methodical gameplay, but because it is so well-developed as a game that it *makes* getting sucked into it incredibly effortless. it genuinely feels like the current best version of whatever these “strand-type” games are meant to be, and if kojima has hit his stride this early, i can’t wait to see what else is in store. if you weren’t the biggest fan of the first game, i almost guarantee *death stranding 2: on the beach* will turn you into one. [inverse - trone dowd]( \- 9 / 10 >*death stranding 2* is another anomaly in the modern gaming landscape. it’s got a weird premise, a weird visual identity, and even weirder ideas for what a $70 game should be. and while this sequel largely iterates on the first game’s ideas to create something broader, it thankfully stays true to what made the original distinct. sure, i wish *death stranding 2* showed more than it tells. kojima could benefit from emulating how concisely many of his director friends in hollywood deliver their own stories. or how to write natural dialogue more consistently. but the overall vision of *death stranding 2* is so bold and uncompromising that it brute-forces its way through these shortcomings. *death stranding 2: on the beach* may not be for everyone. but if it is for you, it's one of the most enjoyable games of 2025, a must-see follow-up that is more cohesive, refined, and fully developed than the first. [videogamer - tom bardwell]( \- 9 / 10 >kojima’s ability to upend established aaa convention is admirable and despite the self-indulgence and the man’s swelling vanity (and appetite for space travel), death stranding 2 is a bold reminder of this. it’s a goofy spectacle, the folly of a man who has let it all go a bit to his head, utterly bizarre and enigmatically incoherent but nevertheless an earnest exploration of loss and connection. at any other studio, such a muzzily, decadent vision would have led to a quiet aside to tone it down or been simply shelved in favour of a safer bet. thankfully, kojima’s auteur status means he’s immune to this, free to fling about millions as he sees fit. long may it continue. [gamingbible - richard lee breslin]( \- 9 / 10 >*death stranding* is one of my favourite games of all time, and i’m equally as obsessed with its sequel. it’s not only one of the best-looking games i’ve ever seen with an endearing cast of characters and soundtrack, but once you look past much of its filler, its story is a message of beauty. humanity cuts itself off from the world, too fearful to make a connection, but when they take a risk to let others in, there’s an unexpected comforting warmth. something that, in one way or another, is a notion we can all resonate with. *death stranding 2: on the beach* deserves to be in the game of the year conversation. it’s hands down one of my favourite games in recent years, and i can’t wait to see what sam and friends deliver next. [thegamer - jade king]( \- 9 / 10 >death stranding 2: on the beach is a hard game to quantify, with kojima productions eager to question our expectations and hurl curveballs at every turn. at its heart, it’s an experience about delivering packages and forging connections across a post-apocalyptic world, but play it for just a few hours, and you’ll see it’s so much more than that. it’s a game defined by filling a nature reserve with teleporting emus as much as it is about a lonely man learning to accept help from the people who love him and avoid being consumed by grief whose sole purpose is to destroy him. it’s about human connection, losing loved ones, and stepping out into the wild regardless of the horrors that may await. learning to go on that journey and accept a willingness to grow is half the battle, and after reaching the end of this ordeal, you’ll never be the same again. keep on keeping on. [worth playing]( \- [chris ""atom"" deangelus]( \- 9 / 10.0 >death stranding 2: on the beach is an improvement over death stranding in almost every way i can think of. it's larger, full of more things to do, and generally a more enjoyable experience. the plot is crazier than ever, which might be a plus or minus depending on your tastes, but if nothing else, it isn't boring. the only complaint i can think of is that the game is perhaps a touch too easy at times, and even that isn't a huge problem. if you liked the first game, it's very easy to imagine you liking the sequel. just be prepared for things to be as unfathomably ridiculous as possible at every turn.

[eurogamer - lewis gordon]( \- 4 / 5 >for those who rolled their eyes at much of the first game, death stranding 2 will likely inspire a similar reaction. but there is no doubt that kojima remains wide-eyed. this big, absurd game is, in many ways, the ultimate synthesis of the writer-director's idiosyncrasies and obsessions while containing, amid the noise, perhaps his clearest message yet. the world may be a mess but its problems cannot be solved alone by communicating over the internet - indeed, retreating into it. go, step outside. don't just touch grass; embrace another person. [gamesradar - oscar taylor-kent]( \- 4 / 5 >the greater emphasis on action and worldbuilding might move death stranding 2 away from the hiking focus i loved about the original but, as a metal gear solid fan, this is a thrilling mix that helps this sequel stand apart rather than just reheating the same thing. ultimately, i really love how worldbuilding has been expanded here, making sam's adventure feel a lot more lively thanks to the drawbridge crew. that's what i'll carry forward from this one – while wishing i had a real life dollman to join me on my weekly shop. hideo kojima compared his approach to the sequel as going from alien to aliens – the same story in a different genre. i can feel that when i play it. but it does have me wondering – as the credits roll after a series of lengthy ending cutscenes that are so bizarre you wouldn't believe me even if i *did* spoil them – what will the alien 3 of death stranding look like? [vg247 - connor makar]( \- 4 / 5 >ultimately, playing through death stranding 2 was an emotional and utterly enjoyable experience, full of thrills and impossible to put down during its bigger moments. my only negative feeling towards it is also unfortunately a big one, that i wish kojima productions went further in evolving this sequel from the original. when the story goes to such an extent to explore new grounds, it's kind of a shame the gameplay feels the need to play it safe. [the outerhaven productions]( **-** [cody perez]( **-** 3.5 / 5 >death stranding 2: on the beach continues the same gameplay from the original without any meaningful innovations or ideas. that said, the brilliant story and unparalleled music and performances make this worth a look.

[gamespot]( \- [diego nicolás argüello]( \- 7 / 10 >the first death stranding was eerily prescient. releasing in 2019, it was impossible to divorce it from the covid-19 pandemic that followed a year later, the parallels between preppers living in bunkers and people struggling to find ways to connect with others reflecting a period of quarantine and uncertainty about the future. by contrast, death stranding 2 is less precise and clear about what it wants to say; it seems committed to making you ponder many things at once, inviting different takeaways. its story touches on topics like the increasing harms of climate change, how our everyday actions are being automated with each passing day, the damaging presence of guns, the clash between governments and privately owned entities, and the importance of helping others in any way we can. if the sequel is prescient of anything, it is that fixation on the past binds us to repeat history, no matter how much we try to pretend otherwise.",865,497,None,0.87,True,False,ChiefLeef22,new,medium,11,self_post

movies,1luy53s,i hated 17 again.,"i hated 17 again. you all know this. it’s a summer day—a really tiring summer day—and you’re just sitting on the couch, bored as hell, wondering what you’re gonna do with your life. so you open netflix, start scrolling, and then you see this: seventeen again. it’s a really old movie. but you decide, hmm, what do i have to lose? apparently everything. starting that movie, it was fine. at least, that’s what i thought. but nooooo. the first few beginning minutes were like, oh, i feel a little bad for the main character, but, you know, he kind of had it coming. because what do you mean you’re doing unprotected boombayah at 17? who does that? well, nowadays people do that, but the movie was from, like, back in 2015 and stuff. but like, let’s be real. let’s freak it up a bit. so i watch it, wondering, hmm, maybe it’s gonna get better. then he becomes 17 again—like the title says—goes back to school, and there, i meet the most hated character in my life. oh wait—maybe i was a little too hasty. let’s go back a little. in the beginning scenes, we’re introduced to the main character’s family: the mom (they’re about to divorce) and his two children. we get undertones of how unhappy they are with their father. like, yeah, you know, typical pre-divorce situation. all that stuff. but besides that, those two characters? i don’t even deign -remember their names. i was like, hmm, maybe they’re gonna be a big part of the story. so, let’s go back again. when he turns 17 again and goes back to school, he meets his son. he acts awkward, the son runs away, all that. but i’m talking about the bathroom scene—where he sees his son being taped to a chair or toilet or whatever. and i’m like, wait, maybe he’s gonna learn that his son is being bullied and help him. that’s gonna be the gist of the story—how family matters the most. and then i was like, okay, yeah, but no. yeah, it’s about that—but i then have to find out that his main bully is dating his sister. y’all remember that he had a son and a daughter, right? yes, that’s what happened. he has a son and a daughter. the son is being bullied, and the daughter is dating the bully. because i remember looking at that and i was shook. i was shook. i was shook. i was baffled. and i remember reading a story on reddit about how this girl got bullied by a guy, and her sister still decided to date him—and how she cut contact because of that. and i’m saying: this movie does not address it at all. like, why is your sister dating your bully? why is she not doing anything about it? that’s not even the tip of the iceberg. and let me not even get started on the uncomfortable relationship between the guy—who now appears as a teen—and the mom. because i get it… not really, i don’t. i don’t get it. but like, yes, the dad knows that he’s internally an adult. but the mom doesn’t. she sees him as a teenager. like, the literal 17-year-old he looks like. but still, there are undertones of romance in their interactions whenever they meet, and that’s weird. awkward. disgusting. i don’t like it. i hated it. and i can rant and rant and rant about how much i hated it, but the part that pissed me off the most was how they never addressed how what the sister was doing was wrong. she’s not a good person. imagine your sibling is getting bullied—and the person bullying them is your boyfriend—and you know he’s doing it. he does it in front of you. somehow, you still let it happen. and i hated it. i hated it, i hated it, i hated it. that’s why i hated that damn movie. well, with all the other problematic things inside, the only normal person in that movie is the brother. because he’s the only one who had a normal relationship—with the girl he liked and everything. and i’m just saying—why? why did the movie have to be so weird? and this is the reason why i do not like 17 again. so i was talking to my sister about how whatever was going on in the movie producer’s head was not it—especially with where they decided to place the romance. and then, when i pointed out that the relationship between the main character and his ex—or soon-to-be ex-wife—was weird because he has the form of a teenage boy, she was like, “i don’t see the problem.” and i’m like, what do you mean? i said, imagine she kissed him when he was in that teenage form. she was like, “well, he’s still her husband.” i’m like, so imagine you were a 36-year-old woman, and your husband became 17 again. you would still kiss him? so am i wrong for thinking it’s weird? or is she weird for thinking it’s fine? because like—what? why are you people like this? why does she think it’s normal? it’s not!",0,19,Discussion,0.15,True,False,Levi_riu_22,new,low,19,self_post

[**metacritic**:]( **71 (42 reviews) -** ***generally favorable*** reviews: [variety (80)]( >the super-busy quality of “superman” works for it and, at times, against it. the movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. that’s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (“the dark knight,” “superman ii,” “the batman,” “guardians”). i’d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes “iron man,” “thor,” “batman begins,” “captain america,” and the hugely underrated “iron man 3”). yet watching “superman,” we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we’re drawn right inside them. gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that’s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure [the hollywood reporter (80)]( >what matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads. [deadline]( >overall, gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. more than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times *superman* suffers from overload, much like gunns’ *guardians of the galaxy* trilogy, which wore out its welcome with vol. 3 where rocket unfortunately got the *babe: pig in the city* treatment. nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. it will be interesting to see where the future lies for dc under his (and safran’s) more hopeful vision. [indiewire (58)]( >gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to superman’s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what’s at stake. it’s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you’re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it’s hard not to admire gunn for trying. but it’s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn’t any gravity to the world around him. grade: c+ [ign (8)]( >superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the man of steel, and a great new start for the dc universe on the big screen. [the atlantic (90)]( >the first superman movie worth watching in years. the newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness. [consequence (83)]( >grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. there are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that superman himself has embodied from the beginning. [collider (80)]( >superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the man of steel fascinating in a way we’ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world’s future, crafting an introduction to the dcu that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. at this point, it’s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. but gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to superman. it ends up becoming one of the best dc films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer. [the guardian - uk (2/5)]( >from the very beginning, this new superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great john williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times. [the wrap (88)]( >a fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard… which are the best flaws a film can have. [entertainment weekly (67)]( >whether gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. with a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film — if only gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first. **grade: b-** [bbc (3/5)]( >it's a shame that gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. it's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. corenswet is well cast – he has plenty of all-american charm both as superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, clark kent – but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys lois lane's company. we don't see any of that. indeed, corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. was gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show superman's sweeter and nobler side? maybe so. in a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a man of steel who keeps having meltdowns. [empire magazine - uk (2/5)]( >david corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of gunn’s signature sense of fun shine through — but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn’t work. [rolling stone (80)]( >it’s faint praise, even in the post-mcu era of the genre, to say that superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. what gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: he’s given us a superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book. [slashfilm (80)]( >yes, ""superman"" is a frequently corny movie because superman is a corny character, a kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. there's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. in our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold. [independent - uk (4/5)]( >david corenswet, rachel brosnahan and nicholas hoult lead a movie that doesn’t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of dc as a whole. [new york times (90)]( >as both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we’ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition. [vulture (90)]( >there’s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. but the film’s approach isn’t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.

movies,1lumfmn,"kurt vonnegut's novels that have been adapted to the big screen: slaughterhouse-five (1972), mother night (1996) and breakfast of champions (1999).","kurt vonnegut is easily one of my favorite authors. so it goes. his novels have both made me laugh out and loud as well as shed tears. i took it upon myself to look at the 3 adaptions of his novels with *slaughterhouse-five,* *mother* *night* and *breakfast* *of* *champions* and look at how they went about adapting vonnegut's unique voice and what may have been lost in adaption. first, we have *slaughterhouse*\-*five*, easily vonnegut's most well-known and read novel, one that has a big place in literary history. the novel, concerning the character of billy pilgrim being ""unstuck in time"" and based on the real-life bombing of dresden (which vonnegut witnessed as a pow), was released in 1969, proving to be such a hit that it was turned into a film only 3 years later. the film adaption would be directed by george roy hill, best known for *butch cassidy and the sundance kid* (1969), for which he won the oscar for best director. the film adaption was well received by critics, winning the *prix du jury* at the cannes film festival. so it goes. even more of a glowing commendation came from vonnegut himself, who said he couldn't be happier with how his novel was adapted. watching the film and i am impressed by how closely they stuck to the novel and the casting was pretty damn good. however, i find that it's one of those films that fails to live up the heights of the novel, especially when it came to how i pictured certain parts and characters as i read it. i'd recommend it to fans of the novel, with the caveat that it isn't the same as reading the novel. secondly, we have *mother* *night*, which has the biggest gap from the novel to the film adaption of vonnegut's works, with the novel being published in 1962 and the film being released in 1996. the novel is about howard w. campbell jr., an american who lives in germany with his family since post-ww1, who becomes recruited by american intelligence to become a double-agent, broadcasting nazi propaganda while secretly communicating with the americans about nazi plans. the film was directed by keith gordon, who is most known for his role as archie cunningham in *christine* (1983), but had directed a few indie flicks before adapting mother night. this is my favorite adaption of the 3 films and it's especially due to nick nolte's fantastic performance as howard w. campbell jr. nolte brings his trademark rage and sense of self-loathing to the role with aplomb. nolte really makes this a one-man show but their are some nice supporting performances by sheryl lee, alan arkin, frankie faison and john goodman. this adaption was also well received by critics and vonnegut also commended the film for how it adapted his novel. so it goes. finally, we have *breakfast of champions*, the novel being published in 1973 and the film being released in 1999. the novel and film concerns itself with dwayne hoover, a well respected businessman whose mental health deteriorates over the course of the novel; the novel also looks at the city dwayne lives in, midland city, as well as exploring the various people that make up the city; also, the novel feature kilgore trout, the biggest reoccurring character in vonnegut's 'verse, who's a curmudgeonly writer on his way to midland city for an arts festival. the film was directed by alan rudolph, a longtime director of indie films in various genres. the film was roundly panned by critics. so it goes. i find this adaption to be the most frustrating, as while it has some of comedy of the novel, it completely misses the pathos. the film also suffers from changing various elements of the novel, cutting out crucial scenes of adding whole new ones. despite the overall disappointment i found in the film, i did come away liking some of the performances. i thought bruce willis did a fair job at portraying dwayne hoover as willis used some of his natural comedic timing to pull off hoover's decreasing mental state. the incomparable albert finney does well in the time he's given as kilgore trout. nick nolte gets the chance to play a zanier role as the crossdressing harry lesabre, with nolte really excelling with the comedic bits.",26,18,Discussion,0.73,True,False,MrPuroresu42,new,low,11,self_post

movies,1lu8bkm,"july 4-6 box office recap – 'jurassic world rebirth' opens with a fantastic $147.8m domestically and $322.6m worldwide on its first five days. meanwhile, 'f1' reaches almost $300m worldwide and becomes apple's biggest film at the box office.","it was a weekend for fireworks and dinosaurs. ***jurassic world rebirth*** opened with a monster $322 million worldwide, showing there's still power in this franchise after 30 years. and while ***f1*** took a rough drop in the domestic market, it's still a hit overseas, as the film is nearing $300 million worldwide and officially became apple's highest grossing film ever. the top 10 earned a combined $152 million this weekend. that's 0.2% up from last year, when ***despicable me 4*** debuted atop. debuting at #1, ***jurassic world rebirth*** debuted with $92 million in 4,308 theaters. adding in its numbers from wednesday and thurday, the film earned an incredible $147.8 million. this is hard to compare with the previous ***jurassic world*** films, as all films opened on friday. so just for reference; ***fallen kingdom*** earned $148 million on its first 3 days, and ***dominion*** made $145 million. what does this debut suggest? what everyone always knew: people love dinosaurs. and that has always been the franchise's biggest advantage. there are no other dino franchises currently, which has allowed universal to cater to an audience that wants to see these monsters in the big screen. there's a lot of franchises that have experienced fatigue, but the ***jurassic*** clearly is still beloved 32 years later after its debut in theaters. the film had a very rushed production; it was officially announced in january 2024, although a script was written for quite some time. gareth edwards was hired one month later, when the current release date was already set. so basically the film was reported, filmed and released in the span of just 18 months. that's very short for a blockbuster. but then again, audiences don't pay much attention to productions. what they care for is if the film looks interesting or catches their interest, and universal achieved it. they sold it as a ""back to basics"" film, choosing to just abandon all characters from the prior films and focus on new characters, played by scarlett johansson, mahershala ali, jonathan bailey. turns it out all worked out. according to universal, 61% of the audience was male. the films are popular with families, although ***rebirth*** starts to point that it's losing some young audience members. only 36% of the audience was 25 and under, which is below ***fallen kingdom*** (56%) and ***dominion*** (41%). at the end of the day, that's pretty much imminent when your franchise is 30 years old. so yes, everything worked out in the end. well, almost everything. what did ***rebirth*** fail at? reception. critics were unimpressed with the film, giving it a mediocre 52% on rt. somehow, that was an improvement over the past two films, but that's still not a good score. regardless, the debut suggests the audience was still excited to watch the film. but the film's word of mouth indicates that this will play very, very differently, and that's another thing were ***rebirth*** failed. audiences gave ***jurassic world rebirth*** a very weak ""b"" on cinemascore, which is very poor for a blockbuster. that's worse than any of the ***jurassic world*** films, and it's the second lowest in the franchise, just above ***jurassic park iii*** (""b–""). this is an indication that audiences are not content with the film. it's hard to point to a domestic total prediction given that this is a 5-day debut, but with high competition like ***superman*** and ***the fantastic four: first steps*** arriving, it's very likely the film will continue the franchise's decline at the box office. definitely a success, but it's gonna put a lot of pressure on the next film. last week's champ ***f1*** added $25.7 million this weekend. that's a rough 55% drop from last week, but when you have a juggernaut like ***jurassic world***, a drop like that is pretty much imminent. through 10 days, the film has amassed $109.2 million domestically, the first apple title to hit that milestone. there's still heavy competition on its way, but ***f1*** should still have enough gas left to hit $160 million domestically. in third place, ***how to train your dragon*** dipped 43%, adding $11.2 million this weekend. that took its domestic total to $224.2 million, finally becoming the franchise's biggest film in the domestic market. there doesn't appear to be any signs of life in disney/pixar's ***elio***. it dropped 45% and made just $5.7 million. that drop is barely better than last week, indicating word of mouth isn't really doing anything to save the film. the film has made an abysmal $55 million so far, and it's going to struggle to hit $65 million at this rate. ***28 years later*** remained at #5, although it still dropped 53% and added $4.5 million this weekend. at least that's better than last week's steep 67% drop, but it's still rough. the film has already earned $60.2 million, and it should finish with around $67 million domestically. ***m3gan 2.0*** continued disappointing on its second weekend. the film collapsed a poor 61%, earning just $3.9 million this weekend. that's far worse than the original's second weekend drop (a very light 39.8%). the sequel has earned a very poor $18.7 million, which is a colossal 68% behind the original through the same point. with more competition on its way, it's highly likely the film will finish with less than $25 million domestically. ***lilo & stitch*** dropped 45% and earned $3.8 million. the film has amassed $408.5 million so far. in eighth place, ***mission: impossible – the final reckoning*** eased just 34% and added $2.7 million this weekend. the film's domestic total stands at $191.1 million, and it will soon pass ***rogue nation*** ($195 million) to become the fourth biggest film in the franchise. ***materialists*** had another rough drop this weekend. this time, it dropped 55% and added $1.3 million. that took its total to $33.5 million. rounding out the top 10 was the 41st anniversary re-release of ***this is spinal tap***. it earned $1 million from 1,015 theaters, taking its lifetime gross to $5.7 million. man, it should've made $1.1 million, come on. #**overseas** ***jurassic world rebirth*** debuted with $174 million overseas, for a monster $322.6 million worldwide debut. china was its biggest debut with $41.5 million, which is the biggest for a hollywood title this year. however, it should be noted that the film was quite front-loaded in the market amidst poor word of mouth. other strong debuts were seen in the uk ($16.6m), mexico ($13.9m), germany ($7.6m), south korea ($7.4m), spain ($6.5m), australia ($5.9m), india ($5.5m/best of franchise), france ($5.3m) and italy ($4.7m). all the ***jurassic world*** films have cracked $1 billion, but don't expect the same to happen to ***rebirth***. not only was it lower than ***dominion*** $392 million worldwide debut, but most of these debuts were all from 5-day debuts, which is boosting its numbers. for now, a $800 million worldwide total is likely. another success in the franchise, but it will continue marking another decline. ***f1*** was impacted domestically, but it continues killing it overseas. despite the arrival of ***rebirth***, the film dipped just 38% and added $56.3 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $293 million. it's already apple's biggest film worldwide. in china, the film had an insane 2% second weekend drop, which is the best for a hollywood title this year, and now the film is set to massively over-perform in the market. the best markets are china ($22m), the uk ($17.3m), mexico ($12.3m), france ($11.5m) and australia ($9.8m). assuming it keeps holding very well, the film should definitely pass $450 million worldwide. ***how to train your dragon*** added $21 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $519 million. the best markets are china ($35.5m), mexico ($33.4m), the uk ($24.6m), brazil ($17.2m) and france ($14.2m). it has already passed the original film's worldwide gross, and by tomorrow it will pass ***the hidden world*** ($520 million). ***28 years later*** added $7 million overseas, allowing it to cross $125 million worldwide. the uk has been its biggest market, unsurprisingly, earning $17 million so far. the film should finish with around $140 million worldwide. continuing its absolutely pathetic run in pretty much every territory, disney/pixar's ***elio*** made $6.7 overseas, taking its worldwide total to just $97.7 million worldwide. the best markets are france ($4.7m), the uk ($4.1m), south korea ($3.6m), china ($3.5m) and mexico ($2.8m). 3 weeks in and a pixar title still hasn't cracked $100 million worldwide. what a time to be alive. ***lilo & stitch*** added $6.1 overseas, taking its worldwide total to $972 million. that allowed it to finally pass ***a minecraft movie*** as the year's second highest grossing film, just behind ***ne zha 2***. the best markets are mexico ($66.5m), the uk ($48.3m), france ($40.5m), brazil ($36.5m) and germany ($30.8m). with $3.9 million overseas, ***mission: impossible – the final reckoning*** has officially passed ***dead reckoning*** worldwide with a $576.1 million total, becoming the fourth biggest film in the franchise. #**films that ended their run this week** movie | release date | studio | domestic opening | domestic total | worldwide total | budget | ----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------: *a minecraft movie* | apr/4 | warner bros. | $162,753,003 | $423,949,195 | $954,928,702 | $150m - *a minecraft movie* has closed its run with a fantastic $954 million worldwide. considering the insanely negative response to its first teaser, it's still a sign of the brand's strength that it could make almost $1 billion. of course, the film's legs were very mediocre (2.60x is not great at all for family films, given those easily pass 3x), which is a sign that they weren't fully satisfied by the film itself. whenever the sequel comes up, they must deliver something better than this, quality-wise. #**this weekend** a new era of dc begins this weekend. that's because it's the arrival of dc's ***superman***, the first film in the new dc universe (dcu). written and directed by james gunn, it stars david corensweet as the man of steel, and it follows superman's journey to reconcile his alien heritage with his adoptive human family. to say that expectations are high for this film is selling it short. as previously mentioned, this is gonna kick off a new dc universe, after the dceu had the insane distinction of having 8 box office flops in a row. and that's not even including the absolute misfire of ***joker: folie à deux***. needless to say, the brand is at an all-time low and ***superman*** will need to win over people. with a high $225 million budget and an extensive marketing campaign, this film really needs to be a home run for the sake of dc. ____________________________________________________________________________________________ if you're interested in following the box office, come join us in

movies,1ltwldr,the legend of bagger vance is brilliant,"you may have stumbled upon the legend of bagger vance on the golf channel and thought “interesting concept to use golf as an analogy for life”. the movie makes some bad cinematic choices at times, and many of the plot points are unnecessary or don’t add much to the whole of thr movie. what makes this movie so brilliant in my opinion? it’s that the movie is based on the hindu sacred text the bhagavad gita, in which krishna tutors the warrior-hero arjuna. it’s not easy to articulate what brahman is according to hinduism, or how one can attain experimental knowledge of it. in fact, intellectual understanding of brahman is basically pointless, as it’s “not something that can be taught or learned, only remembered” as stated in bagger vance. there are several key quotes that do an amazing job at hinting towards the truth of brahman without being overly explanatory, and in fact the at times vague references to it promote inquiry on the viewer in the same way an actual guru would want to a illicit. perhaps the best example of this is when bagger vance is talking to one of the tournament organizers about why junuh hasn’t been playing well, and says it’s because “he still thinks he’s rannulph junuh”, to which the organizer says “he is rannulph junuh though!” and bagger says “well…he is and he isn’t”. this is reffering to the idea that our ego and sense of separation from the whole of reality is an illusion, and that our true identity is atman, our soul that is identical to brahman. nearly every scene with bagger vance throughout the movie is layered with nods to brahman, but in a way where you could watch the whole film and have no idea it’s alluding to hinduism if you’re not aware of the philosophy, and i think that makes it one of the most special movies of all time.",0,12,Discussion,0.32,True,False,TunaSalad47,new,low,15,self_post

movies,1ltly43,"the ""manic pixie dream girl trope"" is not sexist and wildly overhated.","i know. i am a straight white man and i do not understand the experiences and nuance of being woman no matter how progressive and empathetic i try to appear for others who have faced discrimination. but as someone who has recently come across this idea of the mpdg in media, i find this critique of relationship to be incredibly overblown. for those who do not know, a mpdg is a trope in media where a woman, usually eccentric and wild, enters some sort of relationship with a man who defies the conventional ""alpha male"" trope that is usually depicted in romances. some of the most popular examples are summer (500 days of summer) and sam (the perks of being a wallflower) and ramona (scott pilgrim). my issue with the argument that it is sexist comes from 2 very important points: 1. media exists in a different frame than reality. the entire point of media is to fulfill the imagination of our minds that stray away from reality. we do not watch television for the mundane expected things in our lives, but for things that shock us or provide some sort of stimulation (fear, anger, horniness, heartache). the unrealistic love interests extend to all different types of characters and so if the story is about one specific character and another is used as a prop to explore their arc and the way they interact in the world... than it honestly is not that big of a deal. 2. the double-standard between genders. as someone who watches a lot of kdramas, one of the biggest tropes i see if the hot, rich, ripped businessman with all good values be used as a way to bring out the ""country poor girl"" out of her shell and introduce her into the world. no one bats an eye and points out how offensive it is for an entire man's pirpose is to explore the archetype of the woman. it is the same thing. and i do not care because i know it to be media. those ""perfect men"" do not exist in the real world... just as the mpdgs do not. it is all in the head of the person who is at the center of the film. but what do you think? am i actually being sexist and just not cognizant of it? or does my opinion hold some merit?",0,79,Media,0.2,True,False,Over-Heron-2654,new,low,5,self_post

movies,1lth6fa,rrr (2022),"rrr is a 2022 telugu-language indian movie that’s over three hours long. it's a period, action, drama, comedy, musical, epic story. the story follows two men, raju and bheem. they are in 1920s india during the british empire’s rule. raju is an undercover cop, he is performing an investigation to find a man. he doesn’t know what this man looks like, all he knows is that he will be in hiding, not using his real name; in a sense, the man whom he is looking for will also be undercover. while performing this search, raju meets bheem and they become best friends. well, it turns out that bheem is the person that raju is looking for, but during their friendship, he doesn’t realize it. it’s as if in the departed, the matt and leo characters became best friends. the story continues from there, and gets even wilder. if you haven’t seen this film, go watch it. it is a thrill ride to say the least. the action is over the top in the best possible way. the story of friendship between raju and bheem is one of the best bromances ever put to screen. the way they meet is one of the craziest action set pieces i’ve ever seen. it involves one riding a horse, the other riding a motorcycle, both jumping off a bridge, and there’s an exploding train. the music is fantastic. at one point, while our characters are at a somewhat snobby english party, there is a dance-off that is quite ridiculous, but by that point in the film, you are so into the story that it doesn’t matter. it’s not the sort of thing most american audiences would get into, but trust me, you should let yourself experience it. now i’m going to spoil some of the film. there are some twists/reveals that happen, and i want to be able to discuss some aspects of the film that will give them away, so if you haven’t seen rrr, stop reading here if you don’t want the story spoiled. what i want to get into first is raju and what his real background is. the idea up until the reveal is that this whole time, he has just been an undercover cop. this works as a story, but, even as handsome and charming as raju is, the character is a terrible person. he is indian, but all we have seen from him is an extreme desire to be a good soldier for the british empire and do whatever he must in order to gain promotion within the military ranks. once we finally get to the flashback scene where we see raju as a child, we see that has actually gone undercover as a civilian while being a civilian who is undercover as a cop - yeah, i know, hard to do the mental gymnastics, but trust me, in the movie, it’s quite clear. now, after we get to know his true story, i don’t hate him so much. his whole goal has been to bring guns to his people so that they could have a better chance of fighting back the british. but, i still don’t like what he’s done in order to achieve his goal. he has hurt his own people in order to help the greater indian population. the choice to show this flashback before the scene where raju publicly whips bheem makes that flogging even more powerful. raju is whipping his best friend, and a friend he is actually on the same side as, but he still can’t let the british know that. bheem refuses to neel, and through the power of music, turns the public whipping from a tactic of the british to control through fear, into a way of rallying the indian people together against the oppressive english government. meanwhile, raju has to do so much evil to the ones he sides with in order to achieve his goals. at this point i’m also reminded of the man he tortures whilst looking for bheem, as well as all the people he hurt in his introduction scene where he fights an entire mob. luckily, we have another character to compare with raju. bheem’s goal is much simpler. all he wants is to rescue his little sister, malli, from the english woman who kidnapped her. once bheem finds malli, he only hurts people on the enemy side. he never hurts anyone on the same side as him. once he learns raju’s truth, he goes to rescue his friend. the action of the rescue is goofy as hell, but fantastic all the same. actually, that sums up much of the movie, “goofy as hell, but fantastic all the same.” it’s fantastic in how over the top the action is. there is literally a dance-off. one character breaks into song while being whipped in public. the love between bheem and raju is genuine. the way the actor’s use their expressive eyes is top work. like most americans, i’m usually a little bit averse to watching foreign movies, but trust me, rrr is worth it.",0,7,Review,0.41,True,False,antantantantantant,new,low,1,self_post

movies,1ltf24b,why doesn't the pg rating mean anything anymore?,"this is a question that i've wanted to know the true answer to for a long time. because we rarely get g-rated movies nowadays. if they do, they're usually not mainstream. the pg rating used to mean something, but now they're stigmatized as being ""kids only"" movies the same way the g rating was 20 years ago. despite the stigma, that didn't stop the lion king, toy story, finding nemo, ratatouille, or wall-e to be successful & universally beloved despite all being rated g. for years, disney & pixar produced nothing but g-rated material. but then, the success of shrek proved that it's acceptable for movies marketed towards kids to have swearing & sex jokes to appeal to older audiences, and therfore obtain a pg rating. there are several movies from the 70s & 80s that were rated pg but would be pg-13 now. several examples include jaws, star wars, airplane, raiders of the lost ark, ghostbusters, back to the future, who framed roger rabbit, beetlejuice, gremlins, etc. in fact the pg-13 rating was created because the mpaa didn't know where to place temple of doom. the downside is that gory movies like these is all that hollywood wanted to make for years. but then pg movie is now try to be as inoffensive, safe, and sanitized as possible. the give every kids' movie this rating despite not doing anything to justify it. for instance, would parents even bother watching movies like despicable me, frozen, trolls, or encanto with their kids? not really. but we're entering the era where pg movies are starting to take risks & actually earn there ratings. a few examples on the live action front are conclave, wicked, and the sonic movies. and there are many pg-rated animated movies that i can name that justify their ratings as well (both old & new): shrek, (which was mentioned above), the incredibles, coraline, rango, both spider-verse movies, turning red, gdt's pinocchio, nimona, tmnt mutant mayhem, transformers one, and kpop demon hunters.",0,10,Discussion,0.23,True,False,Upper_Paramedic_8588,new,low,23,self_post

movies,1lsfvgt,why i think brad pitt is a cooler / better star than tom cruise?,"below views are my opinion, no offense to anyone. i'm not saying this just after watching f1 - it's something i've always felt and f1 just reinforced that idea. **tom cruise** \- always has this 'i know i am amazing' kind of egoistic-proud look on his face at all times - i mean even on-screen over the past few (7-8) years including recent mi movies. sure, he may have had that 'innocence' in his younger days in films like vanilla sky, minority report etc.but not these days. the ego, the fame has gotten to his head but more importantly it shows on his face and persona. same thing with dicaprio. but here's where our man is different: **brad pitt** \- from a film back in the day like 7 years in tibet - till today in ouatih or f1, pitt's face still has a certain 'vulnerability' - it doesn't scream 'yo i'm a rich superstar and know everything' , there's a certain 'i've gone through a lot of struggle to get here and there's a lot beneath this cool exterior and swag' kinda thing about him. that's why when he plays roles like f1 where 'he was once a successful dude who lost everything and is now having a second chance to prove himself' - we feel that emotion and root for him as his eyes, his wrinkles convey a certain level of that 'pain'. and most of the world isn't rich - most of the world are people 'trying' to succeeed and get better and have many struggles to deal with. so a story + actor/role that embodies that feeling is always likely to hit home! let me know what you feel about this thought of mine :)",0,39,Discussion,0.27,True,False,JudgementalButCute,new,low,17,self_post

movies,1lse8uf,"the texas chain saw massacre (1974) is one those films that while influential, bears little resemblance to the movies it inspired.","the texas chain saw massacre (sic) was shot in a month during a heat-wave on a budget of nothing. for a grindhouse horror film there isn't that much visible blood, nor is there any nudity. the director tobe hooper was honestly banking on the film earning a pg rating at the time. it got an r, but also made turned a profit thirty times over. the cast was made up of locals, and it was filmed around three buildings, a graveyard, and inside a van. massacre is one of those interesting films because, while it inspired later slasher films, the movie itself had no rulebook to follow. the plot and script is thin, more a disturbing trip than anything. there are five main characters and i couldn't tell you their names except for the annoying guy in a wheelchair, franklin. apparently his actor stayed in character between filming, which pissed off the rest of the cast and crew. it may reflect badly on me finding it a relief when leatherface carves a defenceless man in wheelchair like a christmas turkey, but i'll take what i'm given. four of the five leads are killed in quick succession in the middle act, having no idea they're in a horror-movie until it's too late. we don't know them too well, and they don't fit any archetypes. they're not characters, more just random people. aside from an encounter with a creepy hitchhiker and a spot of grave-robbing i was surprised at how normal the first act of the movie is compared the depravity of the last. when i saw the excellent **sinners** there was only scene i thought was superfluous and that's the first one. it's a flash-forward depicting one of the survivors after the main event and we briefly get a glimpse of the vampires. this felt like a pointless concession as the actual first scene properly establishes the same character, while the vampires don't appear until the first act is over, a la **from dusk til dawn**. here, leatherface is interesting as a villain because he comes absolutely out of nowhere. there's no scare chord, no pov shot of him at his work, no prior hint to his existence. thirty-five minutes into the movie a guy walks into a country house in the afternoon, and then he's bludgeoned to death by a giant butcher wearing a flayed face as a mask. leatherface isn't the sole villain either. instead he's just the pitiable son or brother in a family of cannibals, incapable of communicating normally. none of the villains are named, nor are they invincible. one of them gets run over in the street, and leatherface gets belted in the face with a wrench. i find it interesting when antagonists in horror movies experience their own setbacks. unless they're a zombie or explicitly supernatural, they should suffer the occasional pratfall. while the family may bicker and act camp, the film itself never wavers from its gritty and bleak tone. there's a lot of aspects to the film's production that obviously shouldn't be replicated. they used a live chainsaw which almost killed leatherface's actor on more than one occasion. the leading lady was thrown out a window and had her finger cut and sucked by another actor. the crew also spent entire days filming the dining-room scene, having to contend with the heatwave and long-spoiled food. pretty much nobody had to act in the deranged climax massacre is an 80 minute-film about a gang of hapless young adults getting carved up by cannibals. where it a better movie it'd be considerably worse. had the camerawork been more elaborate, the acting more professional, and the special-effects like the old-man mask been of higher quality, the results would have been less interesting. you need a considerable budget if you're depicting a shapeshifting alien in the antarctic, or having a housefly transform into jeff goldblum. but for a minor bloodbath in texas the raw and unpolished feel is the film's best aspect. the director's own sequel was a black comedy, while every other follow-up just kind of existed. the last one made jabs at millennials for some reason. while it may not be worth trying to recapture the lightning in a bottle, given how many of the sequels flopped, i think the method of massacre is still fertile for horror. by shooting the horror like a straight documentary instead of a lavish hollywood film, you make the viewer feel like an uncomfortable witness instead of a safe audience. the horror can happen in the middle of the day with zero warning in a local neighbourhood. the soundtrack can be either absent or come across as utterly maumed, and maybe pay john larroquette in weed to do the opening narration again.",15,12,Discussion,0.67,True,False,DeadRobotsSociety,new,low,16,self_post
movies,1lsdoni,in defense of rebel moon,"i've just finished the two directors' cut versions of the rebel moon movies and, with a few exceptions, really loved them. i haven't seen the previous versions. for the record i don't give a shit about zack snyder, i never really liked any of these movies, even his first ones. i'll take a scene at the beginning of the second film to explain why i really liked them, i'll keep it vague so as not to spoil it. in the first third of rebel moon part 2, there's a surprise assassination scene on a ship. some people arrive, thinking they're inaugurating the ship, and everyone gets killed. a string quartet in the corner accompanies the scene, surprisingly adapting what they're playing to what's happening in front of them. the whole thing is, of course, full of slow motion and superfluous effect. and i loved this scene as much as i loved the film, because snyder and the people around him weren't afraid to be absolutely grandiloquent and ridiculous, taking themselves very seriously to make something epic, in the literal sense of the word, something with big feelings, melodrama, very nasty villains and ultra-heroic heroes. and with the prevalence of marvelization of films (compare old guard to its sequel, for example) where everything is a joke and nothing is to be taken seriously, well, it's good to see something where they’re not afraid of being ridiculous. it's absolutely dramatic in the best sense of the word, and it's good to see that kind of thing. i even liked the harvest scene, it was beautiful. so yes, i know symbolism is the most in-your-face symbolism in the world, the action scenes are based on the rule of cool rather than common sense (thank you general titus for your strategy of making a bunch of peasants run screaming rather than hiding in buildings to snipe at the bad guys), and the visual effects are so present that some scenes are 50% random fireflies, but that's it, it's a pleasure to see, the actors are all beautiful, the robot jimmy has an incredible design and it's anthony hopkins who tells poetry, it's the kind of work that also makes me have big emotions. yes, it's very cheesy and grandiloquent, yes there's a lot of slow motion and everything is enormously produced, but we're entitled to say that it's cool and that sometimes it's good when things are cool. slow motion isn't bad in itself, and here it's used to create tableaux, to say “look how classy this thing is”, and while i understand that some may find it tiresome, i got a real kick out of it. yes, it's not macbeth, but it's grandiose and i found that enjoyable. rebel moon is the 7 samurai in the warhammer 40k universe, with fireflies everywhere. i really hope to have more of it, i want to keep experiencing this universe. i've written all this not to defend my opinion, and not even really to defend the film (yeah the title is misleading), just to ask you not to put them aside just because of what you've read about them.",0,5,Discussion,0.2,True,False,ANormalGorilla,new,low,16,self_post

movies,1lrrt85,is a critically acclaimed dinosaur movie possible post jurassic park?,"after getting to see jurassic world:rebirth last week and seeing the reaction prior to release, this question has been on my mind. as a big fan of gareth edwards and his work, especially godzilla (2014), i was a bit saddened to see the general reaction of critics to rebirth, as i had a lot of hope that it would be at least somewhat well received. before we get into a massive argument about how “critic reviews don’t matter” and “only the audience matters”. i totally understand where people are coming from, and there are plenty of films that i love personally that were absolutely shit on by critics.but i still think that critics have their place. critics generally see significantly more film than the average moviegoer. and while i don’t think critics always determine the success of a film (the entire jurassic franchise is evidence of that), i do think that they can be better judges of quality in a lot of instances. critic ratings are also the make or break for some people who might do research before wanting to go and see a film (i myself have been guilty of this a number of times), so i think whenever a movie is well received, especially when it’s a franchise you like, it’s a big plus. which brings me back to the original question. the jurassic park franchise has had a hard streak of being negatively received, with the past 3 jurassic world films now all being rated as rotten. and it’s not just the jurassic franchise either, 65 was an absolute dumpsterfire, and i honestly have no high hopes for primitive war either. with the latest installment of rebirth, it seems like the most common critique is that it doesn’t exactly do anything new or changes the formula of the previous films. and while i actually liked rebirth, and thought it was a visually stunning film, i absolutely understand where they are coming from with this. which begs the additional question, what needs to be done for a dinosaur film to be a hit with not only fans, but movie snobs as well? i think the first thing that comes to people’s mind might be something like a “book accurate” horror adaptation of chrichtons jurassic park, and while i’d absolutely love to see that just as much as anybody, as long as spielberg is alive, it’s pretty much a given that a reboot isn’t going to happen anytime soon, if ever. the next thing i could think of is what i’d call a “nosferatu” scenario, where a genuinely good dinosaur horror could be made, and be very faithful to the source material of michael chrichtons jurassic park, but under a different name to hopefully avoid copyright. the obstacle of this however, is the chrichton estate appears to be very trigger happy for lawsuits, especially after seeing them going after hbo for “the pitt” accusing the show of being an unapproved sequel of er. the last thing i could see and really hope for, is for darren naish to get his pitch for a big budget dinosaur film approved. naish is a paleontologist who has worked on tons of paleo-media, most recently jon favreaus prehistoric planet, which id argue is only second to walking with dinosaurs (1999) as the greatest dinosaur tv-series to ever exist. if he gets something going, i’d have a lot of faith that he’d be able to pull something off that’s good. to end my rambling i’m gonna leave off with this, what do you think needs to be done to see a praised dino film in the future? if it’s even possible at all? and if there are any critics creeping around, what exactly do you guys want to see in a future film??",0,31,Discussion,0.26,True,False,Kuzmaboy,new,low,19,self_post

movies,1lqyahl,i'm going to be honest; i've never understood the elitism of practical affects over cgi.,"what i've heard said the most over my life has been ""cgi looks fake!"" ""it has feelings of the uncanny valley!"" or ""cgi doesn't age well!"" which is kind of a double-edged sword because there are plenty of practical affects feel like this too and they can look even worse than cgi. a good example is terminator 1 where arnie removes his eye. i remember the first time i saw that and thought ""ugh, that didn't look so hot."" also no matter what, i know that the dinosaur i'm seeing on film isn't real so my suspension of disbelief is already holding up even if it's cgi or not. alot of the time bad cgi is just rushed cgi. good cgi goes totally unnoticed because, well it's good while i feel like you can always point out something that's practical because well, it's still not real. mad max fury road is a great example of top tier practice affects but again, i know everything in that film isn't exactly real so i'm not bothered by any of it. imo it feels like when i was younger, and adults were hating on animated films and anime saying they were for kids simply because they weren't done live. both have strengths and weaknesses but saying one is vastly superior to the other feels wrong to say for me because i can easily watch the 80's the thing, the prequel and the og and look at the affect an say ""that's one nasty ass monster"" because again, i know it's all fake regardless. it doesn't matter if it's good or bad effects what matters is if the intent and emotion of the creator is being felt imo. like some examples being kirk vs the gorn or neo when he fought like 1000 smith's during the matrix 2. those are both moments of simply bad affects that i think we can all just laugh at. also, to this entire point, i honestly can't remember the last time i saw bad effects in a movie. there was one death in the new final destination that i thought looked a bit off but it wasn't really a bad effect just a bad transition into effects.",0,24,Discussion,0.14,True,False,Knalxz,new,low,19,self_post

movies,1lpupyp,law abiding citizen (#2),"i just watched *law abiding citizen*, and while the movie has some obvious flaws, i can’t deny that it delivers an intense and addictive experience. the premise grabs you right away: a man whose family is murdered decides to take justice into his own hands, not just against the criminals, but against the entire legal system that failed him. the performances, especially from gerard butler and jamie foxx, give the story emotional weight and a strong sense of moral tension. there’s something captivating about watching butler’s character pull off complex, deadly plans from inside a prison cell, always seeming one step ahead. that said, the film starts to fall apart under the weight of its own implausibility; many of the plot points are outright impossible, and the twists,while entertainin, demand you completely suspend your disbelief. the excessive violence and chaotic tone make it hard to take seriously at times, and the message about justice versus revenge gets lost beneath all the explosions and shock value. still, i understand why a lot of people enjoy it as a guilty pleasure: it’s fast-paced, dark, and holds your attention all the way through. personally, i was entertained, but i found myself rolling my eyes more than once.",0,7,Review,0.48,True,False,Kaos989,new,low,12,self_post

movies,1lptzi4,is the minority report actually about minority reports?,"i just recently watched the minority report for the first time and i thought it was pretty good and definitely unique. that said, i'm a little confused about the minority reports themselves. the opening half of the movie leads us to believe that minority reports exist as one precog may disagree with the others, and these reports are systematically deleted as to maintain the idea that there is no doubt in the predictions. someone, e.g. anderton, finding out about this corruption would be enough to motivate murder and/or a setup as we see in the movie. the truth is that anderton learned about a specific murder - that of anne lively - and how burgess recreated a planned attempted murder as to avoid suspicion. this is what gives motivation to the framing of anderton. the system of handling precog dejavu is what hides this murder, not the deleting of minority reports. the presumed dejavu vision(s?), which is actually of a second murder, is deleted. if minority reports weren't a thing, and the movie (and book) were titled ""precog dejavu"", things would all fall into place. the precogs have two sets of visions, the second is deleted as it's presumed dejavu and the whole thing is very clever. so what's the point of the minority reports? do minority reports actually occur? the only way it makes sense is if for the first anne lively murder, both male precogs saw the first murder and agatha sees the second, giving us a minority reports. if so, why didn't all the precogs see both murders of anne lively? wouldn't they all see the first murder, and then some time later once the future is written, see the second? i'm getting more confused the more i write. i hope some of you can help me",0,10,Discussion,0.24,True,False,the_breadonator,new,low,12,self_post

technology,6e8wta,eight members of congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill net neutrality as well,"fcc commissioner ajit pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let isps like comcast and verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. his plan would make the internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. we can stop this like we stopped sopa, tpp, and acta. we just need to make it clear that pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in washington wants anything to do with it. here’s what we can do. there are 8 members of congress currently egging the fcc on and helping pai gut net neutrality. they recently put their names on a [statement of support]( or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points]( to show that pai has some congressional backing. they’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of congress now to make sure other members of congress stay away. that way we can starve pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan. here are the 8 members of congress that are publicly supporting pai’s attack on net neutrality: * rep. greg walden (r-or) (twitter: [@repgregwalden]( phone: 202-225-6730) * rep. marsha blackburn (r-tn) (twitter: [@marshablackburn]( phone: 202-225-2811) * sen. john thune (r-sd) (twitter: [@johnthune]( phone: 202-224-2321) * sen. roger wicker (r-ms) (twitter: [@rogerwicker]( phone: 202-224-6253) * rep. paul ryan (r-wi) (twitter: [@speakerryan]( phone: 202-225-3031) * rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers (r-wa) (twitter: [@cathymcmorris]( phone: 202-225-2006) * rep. tom graves (r-ga) (twitter: [@reptomgraves]( phone: 202-225-5211) * rep. bob latta (r-oh) (twitter: [@boblatta]( phone: 202-225-6405) all of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (note: paul ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the speaker of the house does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. but, as speaker, ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.) **call their offices, tweet at them, post on their facebook walls. tell them you are appalled by their support for ajit pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the internet.** we can’t let these members of congress get away with supporting pai’s plan, or else other members of congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. we know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in congress to support pai’s plan. it’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the internet. edit: [u/pperca rightly points out]( that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. while their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of pai’s plan at the fcc, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting pai, so they deserve to be called out too. * sen. mike lee (r-ut) (twitter: [@senmikelee]( phone:202-224-5444) * sen. john cornyn (r-tx) (twitter: [@johncornyn]( phone:202-224-2934) * sen. tom cotton (r-ar) (twitter: [@tomcottonar]( phone:202-224-2353) * ted cruz (r-tx) (twitter: [@sentedcruz]( phone:202-224-5922) * ron johnson (r-wi) (twitter: [@senronjohnson]( phone:202-224-5323) * rand paul (r-ky) (twitter: [@randpaul]( phone:202-224-4343) * thom tillis (r-nc) (twitter: [@senthomtillis]( phone:202-224-6342) * ben sasse (r-ne) (twitter: [@sensasse]( phone:202-224-4224) * james inhofe (r-ok) (twitter: [@jiminhofe]( phone:202-224-4721) edit 2: if you want to submit a comment to the fcc in support of net neutrality, and contact your lawmakers at the same time, you can use this site: [",70004,2202,Net Neutrality,0.89,True,False,corneliuscardoo,top,high,17,self_post

[take action]( that’s what the senate judiciary committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. the [so-called earn it bill]( sponsored by senators lindsey graham (r-sc) and richard blumenthal (d-ct), will [strip section 230 protections]( away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,” meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. the “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by attorney general barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. this is the next fosta - which was disaster for many users and small companies. the earn it bill had its first hearing march 12th, and its supporters’ strategy is clear. because they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to insist it doesn’t affect encryption. “this bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor sen. blumenthal said at today’s hearing. “have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness. it’s true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. but they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption. it would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by the attorney general and law enforcement agencies. and, at the hearing, a vice-president at the national center for missing and exploited children (ncmec) made it clear \[[pdf]( what he wants the best practices to be. ncmec believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that ncmec considers abusive; use screening technology approved by ncmec and law enforcement; report what they find in the messages to ncmec; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others. you can’t have an internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys]( the two are mutually exclusive. concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption]( either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others. the 19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. it’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like ncmec. not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives attorney general barr the power to veto or approve the list of best practices. even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them. the commission won’t be a body that seriously considers policy; it will be a vehicle for creating a law enforcement wish list. barr has made clear, [over]( and [over]( again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. once it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those governments want to suppress. the privacy and security of all users will suffer if u.s. law enforcement is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption. senators should reject the earn it bill. \- deeplinks blog | by joe mullin | march 12, 2020 &#x200b; **e: list of co-sponsers of the disastrous 'earn it' act** thank you u/popular-uprising- sen. blumenthal, richard [d-ct] sen. cramer, kevin [r-nd] sen. feinstein, dianne [d-ca] sen. hawley, josh [r-mo] sen. jones, doug [d-al] sen. casey, robert p., jr.

technology,6ivklm,"net neutrality day of action update: twitter, soundcloud, and medium, have joined. reddit, this could be as big as sopa.","hey reddit, i wanted to give another quick update on the **[internet-wide day of action to save net neutrality]( planned for july 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and internet users are helping organize. the momentum is continuing to build. in the past few days twitter, soundcloud, medium, adblock, twilio, and some other big names [have joined.]( since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including imgur, amazon, namecheap, ok cupid, bittorrent, mozilla, kickstarter, etsy, github, vimeo, chess.com, fark, checkout.com, y combinator, and private internet access. reddit itself has also joined, [along with]( more than 80 subreddits! we've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here]( (feedback is welcome!) edit: a little more info about the plan: on july 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. we'll direct people to [battleforthenet.com]( an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the fcc and congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. we'll also have video bumpers that youtubers and other video creators can use. basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action. **important context from my previous update below.** net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents internet service providers like comcast and verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. title ii is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the fcc is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the cable lobby. this day of action is an incredibly important moment for the internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content. the current fcc chairman, ajit pai, is a former verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. but the fcc has to answer to congress. if we can create another moment of massive online protest like the sopa blackout and the internet slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the fcc in its tracks, and protecting the internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. so! if you've got a website, blog, tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! there's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.]( **edit:** oh hai, everyone! very glad you're here. lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. keep it coming. a lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on july 12. we're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. love all your ideas! keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.]( **edit 2:** it's worth noting that given the current chairman of the fcc's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. the cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. we can't let them. net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. we need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.",44681,1036,Net Neutrality,0.88,True,False,evanFFTF,top,medium,18,self_post

technology,2duzfi,comcast’s corporate response to my recent reddit front page post (“comcast’s notorious unreturned equipment fees”) sends clear message: comcast does not give a sh*t about customers – unless your story goes national.,"*before i can even begin to justify the very charged title of this post, i beg of you to please bear with me and allow me to share the entire context of what has transpired.* i am dann furia, op of [comcast’s notorious unreturned equipment fees]( which made the top spot on reddit’s front page four days ago, highlighting a common comcast phenomenon: customers getting repeatedly billed for “unreturned” equipment and other fees. **the purpose of this post is two-fold:** * share my (previously untold on reddit) entire comcast story * address comcast’s response to my recent front page reddit post about comcast’s fees **part i - my entire comcast story** **during the six month period from mid-january of 2014 through the end of july of 2014, i had to contact comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my comcast account.** i kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as january of this year, and by early july i had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with comcast, that i additionally began recording my interactions with them. during the above-referenced six month period, comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything. now, i completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that i have previously documented at length each of [25 consecutive failed comcast interactions here in a four page comcast blog] ( spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that i possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims. while my four page comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of comcast customer handling. at a minimum, my four page comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service. **part 2 - comcast’s response to my front page reddit post about comcast’s notorious fees** as noted above, i tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from january through july of 2014 to get comcast to help me. comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me. put more poignantly, comcast played an incredibly effective game of “annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (bill maher, 7/25/14). then, *after* my [comcast’s notorious unreturned equipment fees]( post topped the reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, comcast’s corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours. i repeat - not a single comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours? that is interesting. when i listened to the first voicemail from comcast corporate, i felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me. but by the time i made my way through five consecutive comcast corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “comcast fees” post went reddit-viral, i literally began to feel sick to my stomach by comcast’s response. now, i understand that when a comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge. i also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that comcast finally responded to me. having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “special / going public” customer (5 corporate messages in 18 hours). all indications are that comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect). i, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of comcast purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape. so please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective: in a six month period this year, comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while i was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a literally-unremovable $960 termination fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time. comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? zero. zilch. none. null. devoid. comcast’s response when i cancelled my account? they buried me $1320 in fees. comcast’s response when i went public to complain? their corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours. **and so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that comcast has caused a customer:** first, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your comcast experience]( then [share part of your story with reddit]( be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from the verge, gawker, & international business times). perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created. it appears, for the time being, that i might just escape from comcastic purgatory. but believe me when i say this with heartfelt sincerity: i feel genuinely sorry for the rest of you poor souls.",44519,2194,Comcast,0.92,True,False,dannfuria,top,medium,5,self_post

politics,wjoj1w,megathread: fbi searches former president donald trump's florida home,"former president donald j. trump said on monday that the f.b.i. had searched his palm beach, fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. the search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that mr. trump had brought with him to mar-a-lago, his private club and residence, after he left the white house. those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. the discovery of classified information at mar-a-lago was referred to the justice department by the national archives and records administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence. --- ##submissions that may interest you submission | domain ---|---- [explainer: trump says fbi is

gaming,8swmb2,"youtuber ""potates"" completely plagiarized a post i made on r/fallout about fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. the video is now at 800k views.","edit 5: just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. now that things are cooling off, i will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. there are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a youtube channel and i just wanted to acknowledge that. i really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but i don't have anything at this moment to share. thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :) i'm not sure why this thread was locked, i didn't get a message from the mods about it. i assume just because the thread has run its course, and i'm okay with that. **edit 2:** i had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- i only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. i am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and i want to make it abundantly clear that i do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against potates. be better than that. thanks. potates has dm'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. he has been cool about the whole situation and i am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. neither he nor i knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. again, i am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at potates. do not harass him, do not harass his family. these actions are 100% wrong and i condemn them wholeheartedly. calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass. **edit 4:** i am aware that potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. i am not responsible for this, and i have not filed any kind of dmca claim against him as we are settling things privately. i have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his youtube channel, as i believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of youtube again. it is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. but i am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, i am willing to give that chance and let things play out. ------------------- link to the potates video - link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: \^that's a massive fallout 76 info dump based on the noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. it took me a while to write up as i watched the documentary, and i spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement. i'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though i'm not a professional. so to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. when you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck. he starts his video off at the ""gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. as the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. i'm not *too* upset because i'm glad more people got to see the information, but i am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. he reads the post like it was his script! even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words i wrote from a page. i only found this video at all because i clicked it and wanted to hear new fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, i realized that i had heard those words before... because i wrote them! here's the thing. if he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, i'd like to quote this post in a video"", i'd have said go for it 100%. if at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys i found this post on reddit i'd like to read you"", i'd be fine with that. but the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. i feel like i put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. edit: i see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in. --------------- **edit 3:*** ~~i tried to comment on potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. here is what i wrote, if i am able to post it directly on the video i will do so in the morning.~~ **edit 5:** it appears as if the apology video has been deleted. > hey, i'm _robbie. first off, i would like to lead with the fact that i completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @potates and his family. nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. > secondly, i would encourage @potates not to delete his youtube channel. i do not agree that there is no coming back from this. mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. i have seen smaller youtube channels come back from worse. i have given potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that i am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. i truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, i am willing to give potates another chance. > this whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted. me and potates are making things right between us in private as i type this and i am confident that we will come to an understanding.",127327,4668,None,0.9,True,False,_Robbie,top,high,23,self_post

movies,ha4t7t,"adam sandler said he would make a terrible film if he didn't win a best actor academy award for uncut gems. to help him out, i analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad sandler film entitled 'jacked up'","earlier in the year, adam sandler was a guest on howard stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *uncut gems*. during the interview, sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the best actor academy award. [he told howard]( “if i don’t get it, i’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. that’s how i get them.” in a bad news, bad news situation, sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (i’ll still watch it a few times regardless). in an effort to assist the sandman with his terrible film, i dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst sandler picture that could be made. here it is: * *jacked up* * directed by dennis dugan * written by - tim herlihy * pg-13 * running time: 135 minutes * released on netflix * predicted tomatometer score - 6% * predicted imdb score - 3.75 adam sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named jack goodheart who is married to janet goodheart (also, sandler, using a very off-putting voice). they travel to an exclusive resort in costa rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of july weekend. during the event, rob schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including state senator chuck finley (terry crews) and presidential candidate casey fitzpatrick (maya rudolph). during the melee, jack and janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. this pg-13 action-comedy is entitled “*jacked up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. the film is directed by dennis dugan, and co-stars kevin james, chris rock, david spade, salma hayek, terry crews, steve buscemi, taylor lautner, luke wilson, peter dinklage, maya rudolph, and al pacino. [here's the first fan made poster]( i'll add as more people share. thank you /u/kelkith [here is another fan made poster!]( thank you /u/tremetal [another very fun poster!]( this is how i came up with the storyline. i pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. here are sandler's lowest rated films on rotten tomatoes and imdb. i drew a lot of inspiration from them. also, i tried to make this as objective as possible. * *the ridiculous 6 (0% tm)* \- action comedy - action hero * *jack and jill (3% - 3.3 imdb)* \- two sandler's - jet ski scene - married - holiday * *grown ups 2* (7%) - reunited with old friends - married * *bulletproof* (8%) - action comedy * *the cobbler* (9%) - shoe repairman * *the do-over (10%)* \- action comedy - reunited with old friend - married * *grown ups (10%)* \- reunited with old friends - holiday - married * *adam sandler’s eight crazy nights (12%)*\- takes place during a holiday * *blended* (14%) -

these movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two sandlers, and large gatherings. these things are all in *jacked up*. * \*bulletproof (\*$25 million), *little nicky* ($39 million) and *blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. in these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. i left out movies like *spanglish* and *reign over me* because they aren’t traditional sandler comedies. also, *billy madison* and *happy gilmore* weren’t huge earners. however, they established him as a force of nature. * his first or last name couldn’t begin with an “r” - howard ratner (*uncut gems*), henry roth (*50 first dates*), robbie hart (*the wedding singer*). **what does the poster need to look like?** * he cannot be centered on the poster. his best films *punch drunk love, happy gilmore, funny people* and *uncut gems* feature him centered on the poster. *the wedding singer, reign over me* and *the meyerowitz stories* don’t have him centered. however, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% tomatometer average. the posters that have him on the left have a 30% tomatometer average. i’m going with that. he' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films * there needs to be multiple people on the poster. when sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% tomatometer average. the movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% tomatometer average. more is good. * in this poster he needs to be holding something random. in *the cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% tomatometer score. in *the wedding singer* (microphone) and *happy gilmore* (golf club) and *the waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. he needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%). &#x200b; * it’s best if his entire body is on the poster. the movie posters featuring a full-bodied adam sandler have a lower tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%). * ideally, the title would be in the center, because *jack & jill* and *the ridiculous six* have somewhat centered titles. **poster** * title centered * sandler(s) on left side - full body * at least six other characters on the poster there you have it! i can't wait to watch *jacked up*. **if you like this random post, make sure to check out my other random data on reddit.** [movies featuring snowmobile action scenes are way cooler than movies featuring jet ski action scenes]( [analyzing the unnecessarily large trap in predators]( [how old is macgruber?]( [what is the most fast & furious film in the fast & furious franchise?]( [how long did it take the joker's henchmen to build the cash pyramid in the dark knight?]( [brad pitt eating and box office numbers]( [jcvd and his splits]( [how far did the shark travel in jaws: the revenge?]( [matthew mcconaughey's massive jump in reign of fire]( [how far does the creature from it follows travel?]( [people love a bearded kurt russell]( [tracking the merman's murderous journey]( [michael myers road trip in halloween h20]( [stellan skarsgard's journey in deep blue sea was gnarly]( [how fast can leatherface run?]( [jet ski action scenes are the worst]( [a breakdown of the events leading up to sam jackson's demise in deep blue sea]( [the fast & furious & corona]( [how did the geologist get lost in prometheus?]( [how long does it take horror villains to travel from nyc to san francisco?]( [michael myers hates using his turn signal]( [can jason voorhees teleport?]( [how long did the joker need to setup the weapon circle in suicide squad?]( [how much time did batman need to setup the bat fire symbol in the dark knight rises?]( [how much sand did elektra's sandbag trainer in daredevil (2003) require?]( [breaking down the mariner vs. sea eater battle in waterworld]( [analyzing the posters for nicholas sparks' book adaptations]( [how far did nic cage run around in a bear suit in the wicker man remake?]( [how many bullets missed john matrix in commando?]( [how much blood poured out of the sprinklers during the ""blood rave"" in blade?]( [michael myers loves doing laundry]( [dolph lundgren and his front kicks]( [how many calories did shaggy and scooby doo ingest when they ate the cotton candy glob?](",74418,2583,Discussion,0.9,True,False,LundgrensFrontKick,top,high,14,self_post

movies,45sul3,"okay hollywood, ""deadpool"" and ""kingsman: the secret service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""mad max: fury road"" is even nominated for best picture. so, can we please go back to having r rated blockbusters?","i think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated r but overall, i still agree with the sentiment. terminator 2 could not be made today and i think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. the common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". and that would be correct, something being rated r does not inherently make it good or better. but what it does add is realism. real people swear. real people bleed. real people have nipples. r ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. also, and i think this is an even important point, pg-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. i think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. i rarely feel any great sense of emotion. do you think the t-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? probably not. in robocop, would murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? definitely not. sometimes you need that. i'm not saying everything has to be r. james bond doesn't have to be r because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always pg. same with jurassic park. but the problem is that pg-13 has been used for movies that weren't supposed to be like this. terminator was never a family movie. neither was robocop. they were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. and look what happened to their pg-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. the most common justification for things not being r is ""they make less money"" but i think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less r rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. but adjusted for inflation, [terminator 2 made almost a billion dollars.]( (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so i had to knock off some zeroes). [the matrix reloaded made even more.]( if it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. it might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an r rating. hell, even if it's something we don't know about, it can still make money. nobody cared about the comic that kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. in fact, i bet the next one does even better. and deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. but it's crushing records right now and grossed almost three times its meager budget in just a few days. and the only reason it got made to begin with is because of ryan reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. how many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? well, this risk payed off extremely well. i know ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and i really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. sorry for the rant, but i really hope these movies are indicative of hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. this may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but i don't care, i think it needed to be said. edit: holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? i addressed the majority of the points being made here.",53628,2902,Discussion,0.83,True,False,MasterLawlz,top,medium,20,self_post

movies,eh71gy,i saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. here is my full ranking.,"this year i went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. that's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. i usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. i keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs. my ratings are what i give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. it's not meant to be taken super seriously, i'm not a professional reviewer. this is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in: -------------------------------------------------------- **monos - 10/10** - *hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. it's apocalypse now meets lord of the flies, with some beasts of no nation thrown in. it builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a colombian jungle. it almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which i really loved. you get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. got a lot out of its cast. can't recommend this movie enough. really disappointed this didn't make the best foreign language film shortlist. ""masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.* **marriage story - 10/10** **the farewell - 10/10** **journey to a mother's room - 9/10** - *biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. it's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at point a, and end at point a), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. if you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. it's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. it only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.* **waves - 9/10** - *i could write 20 pages on how much i loved this movie. to keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from kelvin harrison jr., sterling k. brown, and taylor russell). visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. it takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. it's also the only movie i went to see twice this year. really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. just watch this.* **last black man in san francisco - 9/10** **birds of passage - 9/10** **apollo 11 - 9/10** - *the best documentary of the year. probably the best editing (and use of sound) i've ever seen/heard in a documentary. it's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. impressive use of archival footage/audio.* **uncut gems - 9/10** - *this movie wasn't on the best original score shortlist for the 2020 oscars. this aggression will not stand.* **the mustang - 9/10** **wild rose - 9/10** - *if this doesn't win the oscar for best original song ('glasgow'), i've lost all faith in the academy. the ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. jessie buckley is gonna be big. best music-drama since a star is born.* **transit - 9/10** **ad astra - 9/10** - *top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful vfx, engaging score. best opening scene of the year. thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a heart of darkness blanket. if you're into space/exploration movies, then i recommend this. surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.* **the report - 9/10** - *this was a really good year for legal-thrillers and the report was the cream of the crop. tight, sorkin-like script with top performances from adam driver & annette bening. could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.* **parasite - 9/10** **once upon a time in hollywood - 9/10** **midnight traveler - 9/10** - *if you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. it puts everything in a different perspective. every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. it's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.* **luce - 9/10** - *it's kelvin harrison jr's world and we're just living in it.* **the irishman - 8/10** **mickey and the bear - 8/10** - *camila morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. ptsd, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural montana, toxic relationships, james badge dale, following your dreams. what's not to love?* **the art of self defense - 8/10** - *the best dark-comedy of the year. so many great one liners. it's like yorgos lanthimos directing death of stalin, set in a karate studio. surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. jesse eisenberg's best movie since.....the social network?* **peanut butter falcon - 8/10** - *""am i going to die?"" ""we all do, it's only a matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.* **everybody knows - 8/10** **mary magdalene - 8/10** **knives out - 8/10** - *well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. just a genuinely fun time at the movies. ana de armas with well-deserved leading role for once. a few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. daniel craig hamming it up with a southern accent was fun. old school film with a modern twist.* **the lighthouse - 8/10** **the dead don't die - 8/10** - *this movie really isn't for everyone, but i loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. the line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. i could watch 10 hours of tom waits talking to himself.* **us - 8/10** **villains - 8/10** **ford v ferrari - 8/10** **midsommar - 8/10** **jojo rabbit - 8/10** **official secrets - 8/10** - *keira knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.* **pain & glory - 8/10** **john wick 3: parabellum - 8/10** **queen & slim - 8/10** **amazing grace - 8/10** - *great concert-documentary. some of aretha franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. i actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. one of my few revised scores this year.* **a beautiful day in the neighborhood - 8/10** **joker - 8/10** **non-fiction - 8/10** - *it's very french (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself, but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. i'm a big fan of olivier assayas and this is some of his best work.* **rocketman - 8/10** **stan & ollie - 8/10** **hustlers - 8/10** **avengers endgame - 8/10** **doctor sleep - 8/10** - *it gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to the shining. didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.* **booksmart - 8/10** **little monsters - 8/10** - *i'd recommend watching this based just on josh gad's character. so over-the-top and hilarious. when he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most i laughed in a theater this year. also lupita nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what i needed in my life. cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.* **spider-man: far from home - 8/10** **a hidden life - 8/10** - *if there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that i'd want played at my funeral, it's james newton howard's theme from this movie. it's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. that song broke me down every time it played. i can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. it's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.* **never look away - 8/10** **toy story 4 - 8/10** **pavarotti - 8/10** **the biggest little farm - 8/10**- *if you're really into the inner-workings of a californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.* **abominable - 8/10** **the current war - 7/10** **artic - 7/10** - *well made, solidly-acted. i loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. i'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.* **bombshell - 7/10** **honey boy - 7/10** - *pretty big letdown because i had really high expectations for this one. lacked the emotional punch i hoped for. didn't land for me at all, kind of like boy erased last year. i appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for shia labeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. lucas hedges' shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and i expected the same for this. it was good, not great.* **american woman - 7/10** - *sienna miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. the accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. the movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. it's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.* **the beach bum - 7/10** **captain marvel - 7/10** **spies in disguise - 7/10** - *looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.* **cold pursuit - 7/10** **tolkien - 7/10** - *not much happens but it felt really comfortable. solid performances all around and they handled the ww1 scenes better than i thought they would. expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. as far as ""nicholas hoult biopics of famous writers"" go, it's miles ahead of rebel in the rye 2 years ago.* **jumanji: the next level - 7/10** **sauvage/wild - 7/10** **detective pikachu - 7/10** **maiden - 7/10** **dark waters - 7/10** - . *good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. total waste of anne hathaway. she's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. not even sure why she was in this. overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre i really enjoy and i've been missing since its late-90s heyday. pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like the insider). should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose* **adopt a highway - 7/10** **the wedding guest - 7/10** **the hummingbird project - 7/10** **motherless brooklyn - 7/10** **the lion king - 7/10** **last christmas - 7/10** - *it's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but i couldn't help walking out with a smile. i love how committed emilia clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. also did i mention how ridiculous that twist is?* **richard jewell - 7/10** - *this was decent. even though it's clearly clint eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the fbi & the spooky media™, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. some of the characters (hamm/wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, i mean come on. you just roll your eyes at most of what they say. some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. it had very solid performances (hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). much better than the mule, and 20x better than 15:17 to paris.* **star wars: rise of skywalker - 7/10** **21 bridges - 7/10** **before you know it - 7/10** **hobbs & shaw - 7/10** - *this is peak ""stupid summer popcorn movie"" and i thoroughly enjoyed it. it's the meg of 2019*. **fighting with my family - 7/10** **pet sematary - 7/10** **downton abbey - 7/10** - *never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.* **yesterday - 7/10** **greta - 7/10** - *it's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but i liked it. sometimes you just need isabelle hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.* **judy - 7/10** - *it's the definition of oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a hollywood legend.* **frozen 2 - 7/10** **aladdin - 7/10** **the souvenir - 7/10** **zombieland 2: double tap - 7/10** - *nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the thomas middleditch/luke wilson scene). above-average for a comedy-sequel, but i could see this one not aging well*. **the two popes - 6/10** - *two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough pryce/hopkins. reminded me of can you ever forgive me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. highly-overrated movie.* **ready or not - 6/10** **anna - 6/10** - *it's basically red sparrow but slightly worse*. **saint frances - 6/10** **hotel mumbai - 6/10** **shazam! - 6/10** - *low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. it hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. it was decent.* **alita: battle angel - 6/10** **loro - 6/10** - *one of the more disappointing movies of the year. on paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt italian politician/mogul by paolo sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? sign me the fuck up. but nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. too much shoehorned religious imagery too. tone is all over the place. it can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. it looked nice at least. it also wins this year's ""most nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.* **teen spirit - 6/10** **the upside - 6/10** **gloria bell - 6/10** - *great performance from julianne moore but this just felt like ""middle-aged crisis: the movie"". just couldn't connect to it. i imagine the original is a lot better.* **on the basis of sex - 6/10** **stockholm - 6/10** **give me liberty - 6/10** - *this is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. there's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. it's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. a lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but i don't see it. rough editing, bad soundtrack.* **child's play - 6/10** **good boys - 6/10** - *just watch booksmart instead*. **styx - 6/10** **woman at war - 6/10** **the lego movie 2 - 6/10** **missing link - 6/10** **long shot - 6/10** - *the chemistry between charlize theron & seth rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. it's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.* **echo in the canyon - 6/10** **cyrano, my love - 6/10** **dora the explorer - 6/10** **brittany runs a marathon - 6/10** **it: chapter 2 - 6/10** - *way too long. felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. good cgi & acting though.* **mister america - 6/10** **crawl - 6/10** **trial by fire - 6/10** - *great performances by laura dern & jack o'connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. it doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.* **the third wife - 6/10** **godzilla: king of monsters - 5/10** - *this needed less humans, more monsters.* **glass - 5/10** **escape room - 5/10** **terminator: dark fate - 5/10** **dumbo - 5/10** **all is true - 5/10** **brightburn - 5/10** **the white crow - 5/10** - *one of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. reading the wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an oscar contender. instead it was just okay. watch cold war instead. it's basically this movie but better.* **high life - 5/10** - *unpleasant.* **where'd you go bernadette? - 5/10** **scary stories to tell dark - 5/10** **her smell - 5/10** - *this movie made me physically nauseous. the tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. it's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from elisabeth moss. but then deflated by a terrible final scene.* **by the grace of god - 5/10** - *based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, i walked in expected to be blown away. basically expected spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. hard to sit through*. **blinded by the light - 5/10** **the best of enemies - 5/10** **the aeronauts - 5/10** - *this is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.* **fall of the american empire - 5/10** **family - 5/10** **the goldfinch - 5/10** - *it turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? shoutout to jeffrey wright & finn wolfhard for actually trying.* **angel has fallen - 5/10** **gemini man - 5/10** **late night - 5/10** **black and blue - 5/10** **diane - 5/10** - *this was just depression-porn. sometimes it works (mungiu/zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). it's such a bummer. wouldn't recommend this to anyone but mary kay place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.* **destroyer - 5/10** **how to train your dragon 3 - 5/10** **rafiki - 5/10** - *i feel bad for this score because i get that this is a really important/significant movie for african cinema, but i just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.* **captive state - 4/10** **wild nights with emily - 4/10** - *this movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned emily dickinson's life into an snl skit?"". i get what they were going for, and molly shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie i've ever seen.* **dark pheonix - 4/10** **the addams family - 4/10** **midway - 4/10** **to dust - 4/10** **rojo - 4/10** - *the only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. so that was cool, i guess.* **the kid who would be king - 4/10** **mib: international - 4/10** **the kid - 4/10** - *there's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. it somehow got 2 big names (pratt & hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. directed by vincent d'onofrio for some reason (???). was dumped by lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. it's dated, boring, and unoriginal. cheesy dialogue. literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. no reason for this to exist. chris pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.* **ramen shop - 4/10** **the good liar - 4/10**- *the most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. helen mirren & ian mckellen both phone it in (i don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). i hate when movies try to crowbar ""ww2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.* **climax - 4/10** **harriet - 4/10** **lucy in the sky - 4/10** - *once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. this is that movie. natalie portman had another movie like that last year (vox lux). hey noah hawley, what the fuck?* **freaks - 4/10** - *this movie would fit well in the ""good idea but bad execution"" subreddit.* **tel aviv on fire - 4/10** **ma - 4/10** **frankie - 3/10** **stuber - 3/10** **serenity - 3/10** - *in a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, last christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. it's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. how they got a-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. it's almost ""so bad its good"". almost. i can't wait for the sequel, free guy, next year.* **maleficent 2: mistress of evil - 3/10** - *more genocide than i expected for a live-action disney fairy tale movie.* **donnybrook - 3/10** **the photograph - 3/10** - *zzzzzzzzzz...* **charlie's angels - 3/10** **hellboy - 3/10** - *this movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. it's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. it reminded me of the predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid i guess). bad cgi and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which i hate.* **happy death day 2u** - 3/10 - **the sun is also a star** - 3/10 - *it's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.* **don't let go** - 3/10 **the invisibles** - 3/10 **playing with fire - 3/10** - *this was just like mark wahlberg's instant family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. no lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. it was the only time i even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.* **cats - 2/10** - *there's not much more i could say that already hasn't been said. yes, it was bad. no, it wasn't the worst movie in history. for me, it was just so boring. forgettable songs (except beautiful ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. just wanted it to end. jennifer hudson just floating into space for no reason, judi dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, ian mckellen slurping milk from a bowl, extremely-hairy-and-naked-idris-elba, cockroach genocide, etc. these things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.* **rambo: last blood - 2/10** **the sound of silence - 2/10** - *more like the sound of boredom, amirite? no but seriously, that's all i got. this movie was the closest i got to falling asleep in my seat this year.* **synonyms - 2/10** **black christmas - 2/10** - *extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2d characters. shitty ending. wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. about as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.* **after the wedding - 2/10** - *overacted, muddled garbage.* **47 meters down uncaged - 1/10** **shaft - 1/10** - *crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. there's a million adjectives i could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. this is one i'm surprised i didn't just walk out of. probably didn't have anything better do do that day.* **jexi - 1/10** - *this year's worst movie. it's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. it was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. there are no redeeming factors. on the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. no memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. none of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. if you had a freshman high-school film student remake her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. the fact that i paid money to see this is something i will never live down.* -------------------------------------------------------------- **movies that i saw outside of theaters, not included in the list:** * **the king -

movies,ffyvir,nicolas cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010s. i watched all of them.,"a couple of weeks ago, i showed my son national treasure, and the whole time i kept thinking “damn, i really miss nic cage”. i knew that he was pretty much in the dtv world for the past 10 years, but i didn’t realize to what level. turns out that nicolas cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010’s, and almost immediately, i was determined to watch every one of them. so i did. in no particular order: **the trust. 7/10.** a not half-bad way to start things off. it's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and elijah wood play well of each other. cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. there's a good story here but it's never fully realized. we are treated to a cage out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go. **kill chain. 8/10.** this one was really enjoyable! it's sort-of 3 different stories or vignettes that all come together in the second half, which is where cage enters the picture. he never cage's out, playing pretty restrained the whole time (though there is one moment where he comes close). the writing's a bit ham-fisted, and the characters are pure stereotype, but it's well crafted and a very entertaining 90 minutes. so far so good. with 27 to go, things are looking up! **the runner. 5/10.** unfocused and uneventful. it’s well cast and there’s a feeling of “this is a real movie” but it wants to be too many things. there’s a decent movie buried in here, but at a brisk 82 minutes, it’s hard to find. there’s no cage rage on display here, instead playing it very understated. it’s quality acting though. three films into this little odyssey, and so far these are more than just paychecks for him, doing the best he can with what he’s given. **rage. 6/10.** it’s ok, but it’s sloppy. the whole time i’m wondering why nothing seems to piece together, and it’s ultimately all in service of a shock ending that undermines everything that came before. once again, cage is solid in this. he keeps things entertaining where others may have had me checking out. one intense cage out, but i expected more based on the title and premise. nevertheless, we journey forward. 4 down, 25 to go. **between worlds. 10/10.** i’m going to be fast and loose with the spoilers on this one. joe is a down-on-his-luck truck driver who lost his wife and kid to a house fire some years prior. in the first 10 minutes of the movie, joe is at a gas station pit stop where he finds julie being choked out by some dude. joe steps in and knocks him out, much to her dissatisfaction. why? because 1 hour prior, her daughter was in a motorcycle accident and is now in a coma, and because of a childhood incident, knows that if she is unconscious she can cross over to “the other side”. so her plan was to have some rando choke her in a rest stop bathroom so she could guide her daughter back to the land of the living. joe interrupted the process, so he offers to give her a ride to the hospital. once there, she asks joe to choke her in the hallway so she can try again to reach her. “something” goes wrong, and instead, joe’s dead wife is brought back in the daughters body. the next 30 minutes see joe moving in with julie and playing house while dead-wife-in-daughter (dwid from this point on) slowly creeps around trying to seduce him. it’s the halfway point when joe is made aware what is happening, and by extension julie and the movies 1 other character. they all accept this very easily. it’s around this time that we get to a scene where joe and dwid are fucking, interspersed with a scene where joe and his wife before she died are also fucking. in both of these scenarios, his wife wants him to read poetry while they fuck. the poetry joe proceeds to read in both scenes is from a book titled, i shit you not, “memories by nicolas cage”. more stuff happens, and at the end of the movie, through various circumstances, joe is doing a classic cage scream-cry, one arm hugging a jack-in-the-box that presumably belonged to his daughter, and in the other, he is dousing himself in gasoline. he then lights a cigarette, which of course ignites his entire body, and he smokes in a completely normal manner while his body burns. this all happens while leader of the pack is playing, a song that holds absolutely no significance to anything that has come prior. throughout, music that feels directly ripped from twin peaks is playing, and the whole atmosphere is begging to feel like david lynch. is the kind of movie you would find on cinemax at 2am on a random wednesday in 1995. it’s fucking glorious. at this particular moment in my life, my greatest fear is that with 24 films to go, i will never again reach these heights. **inconceivable. 7/10.** it’s your typical nanny-isn’t-who-they-seem-to-be sort of deal, but it’s actually entertaining enough. it’s all pretty rote stuff, but there’s nothing offensively bad here. cage gets 4th billing, with absolutely nothing to do other than play the can’t-see-what’s-really-going-on husband. he’s still decent at it, but this actually does feel like a paycheck movie for him, given that i can’t find any reason he would have looked at the script and thought he had something interesting he could do. **the humanity bureau. 3/10.** lame, cheap, uninteresting near-future story that doesn’t have anything new to say that hasn’t already been said better in dozens of other movies. cage is actually asleep at the wheel on this one, just kind of making his way through. in fairness, he isn’t given anything to do. thus far, these movies have managed pretty decent supporting casts. here though, it’s pretty much canadian tv extras. things are starting to feel rocky with 22 left. **outcast. 4/10.** meh. anakin skywalker is a 12th century knight escorting hunted royalty to safe haven. it’s surprisingly not as cheap as i expected, but it’s a completely unoriginal and boring movie. my only reason for watching, sir nicolas, does not even enter the picture until the final 30 minutes. he really hams it up with the old english accent, but he can’t save the movie at this point. things are gonna need to start turning around soon. maybe a between worlds injection every 3 movies. **primal. 6/10.** a movie where a jaguar, a killer and nicolas cage are all loose on a boat in the middle of the ocean should not be this dull. it’s no fault of cage, who hurls some great insults throughout when not chomping on a cigar, and the rest of the cast seems game (except you, jean grey), so it really comes down to the film itself, which just doesn’t use its premise to the fullest. the whole thing is visually bland, too. it’s so muted it borders on black and white sometimes. i had high hopes going in, but thanks to this little journey of mine, i now know director nick powell from yesterday’s outcast endeavor, and as soon as his name popped up in the opening credits, those hopes came crashing down. **running with the devil. 7/10.** flawed and sloppily made, but still entertaining enough, mostly due to its surprisingly a-list cast that never gets to do much. it's not nearly as cool as it wants to be though. what feast made a great joke about in its opening few minutes, this movie tries to do for real, to eye rolling effect. cage is very low-key in this, with laurence fishburne of all people having the most fun. his characters sexual proclivities serve no purpose, and an early montage of them would be pointless if he wasn't so much fun to watch. perhaps the biggest disappointment though is that nicolas cage and adam goldberg get some screen time together, and rather than take this opportunity to have them out-anxious each other, nothing comes of it. i'm so d-d-d-d-d-disappointed. **a score to settle. 8/10.** went in expecting a typical revenge flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see something more. cage is really great in this, and i'm more and more impressed by him with each movie. he really disappears into each role, never doing the same thing twice even if he sometimes is playing similar characters. there are a few moments of the cage madness here, much in the same way that christopher walken or sam rockwell try to dance in every movie they do, but the more subdued acting takes center stage. **the frozen ground. 8/10.** tight cat-and-mouse type that focuses on the procedural more than the thriller aspect and is better for it. cage is in top form, and cusack ain't half bad either. might i want to dip my toe into his dtv output next? perhaps. 17 to go first. **211. 1/10.** jesus fucking christ. **dying of the light. 6/10.** **dark. 7/10.** as it exists in its official form, it’s a middling cia thriller with an intriguing cage performance being the most interesting part. in it’s “director’s cut”, which is even less of an actual movie than donner’s superman ii, everything is much more intriguing, and had schrader been able to make an actual final cut, this could have had the potential to be great. the concept of a dying cia agent spending his last days trying to catch a dying terrorist is a solid one, but it isn’t fully realized in either version as is. cage’s performance is a little manic in both, but more fleshed out and sympathetic in the later. cia business aside, i’d have liked to watch 90 minutes of cage just losing his mind. actually that movie could be 3 hours long and still not be enough. **stolen. 9/10.** a cheap taken knock-off crossed with a heist movie that’s a stupid amount of fun. josh lucas is gloriously unhinged here, out cage-ing the man himself. can the remaining 14 keep up? **arsenal. 5/10.** dtv mediocrity that tries too hard to be cool. cage is hamming it up in a small-ish role, and certainly makes his scenes entertaining, but the rest of the dtv-all-stars are bland. **seeking justice. 8/10.** it’s packaged as a revenge thriller, but it’s much more in line with 13 sins/the game/nerve. the whole thing is pretty ridiculous, but it’s a lot of fun to watch. it doesn’t use its new orleans setting as well as stolen, but the two would make for a hell of a double feature. **dog eat dog. 7/10.** weird movie, but compellingly so. shrader gets his editing jollies off that he couldn’t do on dying of the light, but i’m not sure it does much to add to a movie that is otherwise a pretty simple tale of low-level criminals wanting to hit it big. cage and dafoe is a great pairing, but it’s never fully utilized, outside of an odd, half-naked condiment fight. **vengeance: a love story. ?/10.** after the first 10 minutes, where you can fill a card 100% while playing cop trope bingo, you get the deformed child of two very different movies. in the first movie you have a fairly dark, if poorly constructed, movie about the aftermath of an assault and rape where any one aspect of which could have been explored, but instead the writer and director give us a whitman's sampler of plot threads with none of them fleshed out beyond the initial idea. nicolas cage is not in this movie. in the second movie however, nicolas cage stars in what i can only think to describe of as city of angels 2. after tragically losing his dear maggie to that damn logging truck, seth moves out of la and assumes the identity of john drormoor, becoming a policeman who years later becomes involved in the lives of a mother and daughter in the aftermath of a violent attack. after what is obviously seth/john trying to communicate with cassiel at the edge of a waterfall for guidance, he is given a much warranted promotion from angel to avenging angel, serving due justice to the duos attackers. these two movies have been edited together. i don't know how to give this a numbered rating. there are 10 remaining. **uss indianapolis: men of courage. 3/10.** a poorly made movie that plays like a work of complete fiction. the use of a famous quote 50 years before it was coined is particularly atrocious, as is tom sizemore, acting as though he were tobias fünke trying his best at an academy award. this is the first straight-up bad movie thus far. up until this point they’ve either crossed over into so-bad-they’re-good or cage has given a performance that keeps things entertaining and watchable. uss indianapolis is just a lame movie across the board. **joe. 7/10.** a solid movie with a really great performance by cage, but i found its most engaging storyline sidelined by too many others that make the movie feel really long. there is no fun to be had here, and little worth revisiting down the road. **color out of space. 8/10.** delivered what i was hoping for on most accounts, but continues to prove that adapting lovecraft, especially on a low budget, is very difficult. there are some real horrors on display though proving that practical effects are still king, and cage is great, showing again his talent and desire to really put his all into every role. **grand isle. 6/10.** a came cast keeps things going for the first hour, which is essentially a single location play, but it all starts to fall apart in the third act. grammer has about 10 minutes of collective screen time and only 30 seconds of those shared with cage. kadee strickland is the most surprising here, matching cage's enthusiasm and keeping the whole thing very entertaining, but it ultimately amounts to very little. the low-budget also doesn't help, constantly referencing a hurricane that is never seen. a shame really, cause you can see the potential for something greater here. **looking glass. 5/10.** a thriller without thrills, trying so hard to be mysterious and failing at each try. cage is given nothing to do but walk around and look confused for 100 minutes. things rarely happen, and when they do they make no sense by the end. there's a solid first act setup with some cool ideas, and every single one is wasted. i was hoping for something along the lines of 8mm, but this was not that. the final 5 remain. **mom and dad. 8/10.** a deranged concept which cage is perfectly suited for, but like my issue with nicholson in the shining, he’s already a little crazy before he goes crazy. i love the tone set with the opening credits, but taylor goes to frenetic too quickly, never letting us settle in before cranking things up to 11. all that aside, it’s a totally bonkers movie and watching cage let loose is always 100% entertainment. as a whole it just lacks the finesse to bump this up to top tier. **trespass. 8/10.** there’s more than a few stupid character decisions, and i don’t love the way the flashback structure is done, but the performances across the board are really good, and the intensity level is consistent throughout. **pay the ghost. 7/10.** a pretty decent spookfest that creates a moody atmosphere and some chilling imagery. while “color out of space” falls in the horror genre, and cage has done more than a few thrillers, this is the only actual scary movie he’s ever done. i’d like to see more. **army of one. 4/10.** cage sounds like he’s doing a rain man impression the entire time, and the movie is narrated in a wake up, ron burgundy style which is just awful. a very unfunny movie that is more annoying than anything else. **mandy. 10/10.** there was no better way to end this journey. cage is smartly restrained for a majority of the picture, but when the beast is let loose, the beast is let loose! a fever dream of a movie that delivers on all accounts, and something that will be re-watched in years to come. [ edit: in order to keep the title streamlined i said ""direct-to-video"". perhaps what i should have said was ""movies that did not have a nationwide theatrical release"". edit 2: you are all incredibly kind! i very much enjoyed this, and it only furthered my appreciation for nic cage. he currently has 4 movies in post-production, and i’m eager to watch each one of them. to answer a common question, each movie was reviewed on its own merits, and not on any sort of curve or in-comparison to another movie. edit 3: how did i watch them?

movies,k6ze6l,my 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that die hard is indeed a christmas movie. [spoilers],"last year, i introduced him to die hard and i said it was one of my favorite christmas movies. all year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at christmastime. my argument was that the whole reason john mcclane was even in los angeles was to see his family for christmas and the only reason he was at nakatomi plaza was for the xmas party. he wasn't having it. so tonight i introduced lethal weapon, which honestly, i had forgotten was also set around christmas. but there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for xmas, everyone's saying ""merry christmas"" to each other. so i start saying ""look, another christmas movie like die hard!"" because i know he's going to argue that it's not. he impressed me this time: he said that if you take christmas out, it doesn't change the story. and he's 100% right; lethal weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of august. christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. so i pointed out that gruber's gang in die hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the fbi out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. you take xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. and again, mcclane is in that building specifically because it's christmas. no christmas, no die hard. he's not happy about it. so tomorrow we're going to have to watch love actually and see what he thinks.",48280,2724,None,0.79,True,False,gynoceros,top,medium,2,self_post

(((( mega edit )))) well... holy smokes, le blow up... and some of you have no sense of humour. a few comments. a) i don't hate netflix in general. people saying ""just stop paying for it"" are being ridiculous. i even get that a lot of people *like* the autoplay feature, which is great. i just don't like that it's *automatic* and there's no option to turn it off (for me, at least). b) i think for some reason you guys have options when you watch that i don't. none of your suggestions work for me, or seem available. probably depends how you're watching netflix. i'm using a sony smart tv. maybe i truly am ""retarded"", as some of you insist. but i don't have the settings menu ya'll are talking about, that's for sure. c) i'm howling at the comments about ""entitlement"". uh, what? i'm paying for a service here, not asking for my student loans to be cleared. if we don't like something we're paying for, we're ""entitled"" so say something about it. d) as for the ""don't get so excited"" posts. well, firstly, alcohol. secondly, obviously the issue isn't that big of a deal, that's why the obviously over the top response. i dunno, i thought it was funny. certainly didn't think anyone would care about it. what's really interesting is how pissed off people get that i even posted it in the first place. oh, sorry, let's get back to how exciting that fifth poster is for (insert 483rd marvel sequel here). e) some of you don't sit through the credits. that's cool, but some of us (apparently a *lot* of us) do. f) if you've never gotten to the end of a film and felt the need to sit there and think about it for a bit... that's... really sad. g) weirdly, the thing that set me off was *blue thunder*. i loved this movie as a kid, loved the shitty electronic score... so when i got the end i'm like ""oh yeah, there's this extendo version of the theme which was pretty sweet"" and then i get there and boom it's like no music only trailer. and it made me thought of other times when i wanted to just relax and think about what i'd seen, and popped. er, half-popped.",47539,3293,None,0.71,True,False,snarpy,top,medium,8,self_post

[collider]( > can you make a movie so bad that the academy takes back your best director oscar? asking for tom hooper. [the beat]( > cats is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs. [hollywood reporter]( > cat-astrophic. [la times]( > ""cats” is both a horror and an endurance test. [slashfilm]( > there is a thin line between idiocy and genius, and cats pukes a hairball on it and rubs its ass all over it. [variety]( > nine may not be enough lives for some of the stars to live down their involvement in this poorly conceived and executed adaptation of andrew lloyd webber’s hit musical. [little white lies]( > i felt the light inside me slowly fading. [the playlist]( > once tom hooper's 110 minutes of cats are over, theater is dead. and we unchosen ones are left, tragically, to continue living. [new york times]( > it's amazing to see what adult swim can accomplish with a $100 million budget. i never knew tom hooper was capable of making a surrealist nightmare that would rival jodorowsky, that could baffle david lynch, that would prompt even the dark god cthulhu to emit an impressed eldritch shriek of “nehehehehehe” [vulture]( > to assess cats as good or bad feels like the entirely wrong axis on which to see it. it is, with all affection, a monstrosity. [the daily telegraph]( > glad to report that cats is everything you’d hoped for and more: a mesmerisingly ugly fiasco that makes you feel like your brain is being eaten by a parasite. a viewing experience so stressful that it honestly brought on a migraine.

[the guardian]( > a purr-fectly dreadful hairball of woe. 1/5. [indiewire]( > tom hooper’s feline musical is an absurd and exuberant mess. this visually dense adaptation of the andrew lloyd webber hit is at once too crazy for this world, and not quite crazy enough. [newsday]( > fans of the stage musical may swoon, but others will be severely allergic. [the wrap]( > andrew lloyd webber’s feline fantasy musical becomes a garish hairball. it’s hard to “ruin” webber’s already strange musical, but tom hooper’s wrongheaded attempt certainly tries. tom hooper’s jarring fever dream of a spectacle is like something that escaped from dr. moreau’s creature laboratory instead of a poet’s and a composer’s feline (uni)verse, an un-catty valley hybrid of physical and digital that unsettles and crashes way more often than it enchants. [bleeding cool]( > cats is a strange beast to begin with, but the combination of strange cgi makes the translation from stage to screen even worse. [slant]( > this adaptation gets straight to the heart of the material, which is basically two hours of stray cats introducing themselves. [rendy reviews]( > on a scale of one to zemeckis, hooper's cats boldly goes beyond the uncanny valley and creates a tier of its own. screen junkies > a spectacular disaster...this movie feels like a prank but i don't know on whom. [the jam report]( > the most inexplicably bizarre film of the year, it's jawdropping for all the wrong reasons. [rte ireland]( > first off, full disclosure - i am not a cat person. second off - after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of andrew lloyd webber's cats, i'm not altogether sure i am a movie person anymore either. ----------------------------------------------- **plot:** a tribe of cats must decide yearly which one will ascend to the heaviside layer and come back to a new life. **director:** tom hooper (the king's speech, the danish girl, les miserables) **budget:** $95,000,000 **release date:** december 19, 2019 **starring:** * james corden * judi dench * idris elba * ian mckellen * jennifer hudson * jason derulo * rebel wilson * taylor swift * francesca hayward **runtime:** 110 minutes **company that probably regrets spending $125m+ on this movie:** universal",46351,8580,None,0.93,True,False,BunyipPouch,top,medium,0,self_post
