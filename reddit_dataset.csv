What do you think (if anything) is worthy to join that list? 


I personally have three I think are *very good*, but not necessarily top tier.

1. House Beneviento from Resident Evil Village - I know most would probably rate Castle Dimitrescu higher, but the sudden shift to more puzzle-based gameplay and the dichotomy between the more mundane house and the horrific creature(s) within really stuck out in my mind.

2. Ashtray Maze from Control - A mindbending power fantasy in the best sense, all set to heavy rock. A highlight. 

3. The Halligtree from Elden Ring - The best overall legacy dungeon in the game in my opinion, with an interesting descent that starts in the top of the branches and spirals down and down until you get to the cavernous interior, and ends in the meme-worthy Malenia, blade of Miquella.

It was like this for a while until I got the ability to buy them myself. That sounded awesome, I could get so many videogames, something I would get like twice a year before. But this is when I feel gaming became less magical. Now I had access to a much larger library, but it didn't feel as good. That magical, amazing feeling when booting up a game is gone. I have almost no emotion when playing games now, almost bored I guess, or not enthusiastic, and none of them feel as special now as they did back then.

gaming,1lv0j0j,Xbox layoffs,"I just wanted to see what everyone's opinions are on the recent Xbox layoffs.  It's a complex issue with countless people involved and I hope anyone laid off finds themselves with a new job soon.  My big problem with it I guess is that some of the layoffs make sense from a business perspective.  I'm sad to say it but the Rare job cuts do make sense to a degree.  They haven't produced anything really commercially viable besides Sea of Thieves that actually made the hefty purchase worth it from a purely business perspective.  Everwild looked kind of cool but obviously it lacked a stable core and it just never found its footing.  I agree with a lot of the moves they are making, like shifting Halo to Unreal engine for the future.  On the other hand it's kind of insane that they got rid of Tango and had cuts at Turn 10.  Forza was doing well and while Hifi Rush was a little bit niche but if you can keep the budget in check and not expect Call of Duty numbers, I think it was great.  

The biggest upset for me was the Perfect Dark cancellation, it seemed to be nearing the finish line in a year or two and had numerous teams pulled in for help.  I know everyone hates when artistic expression is stamped out by business but I understand why MS finally had to cut their losses on Everwild for sure.  They have so many good franchises to work with and I hope they turn things around with a happy medium of artists being happy and the shareholders being happy with the profits.

I'm sure it boils down to management at the end of the day and I hope that everyone can find that happy middle ground.  As a gamer I try to do my part and talk with my money and I urge everyone to do that same.  I bought Clair Obscur day one after seeing the reviews because that's what I want to see more of, and I refuse to buy into free to play with micro transactions because I don't like the idea.  I know it's a small thing, I just don't like seeing the same games over and over and I really hate seeing people losing their jobs.  I can also understand that businesses need to see profit to stay in business.

As a reminder, EULAs are NOT legally-binding documents, and they can't be applied in place of local law. Unless what you're doing is already illegal for other reasons, they can't legally punish you in any way, but they can terminate your agreement and ban you from their service forever.

gaming,1lul1cn,Does there exist a game with this specific gameplay loop?,"Hi.

I'm curious whether there is a game like this:

An adventure / action / RPG game where you explore the world, gathering resources along the way, which then goes into a management sim where you spend the resources to build a city or home base



Here are some examples of games I've played that come close to this idea but don't quite fit:

- Little King's Story
- Suikoden
- Harvestella 
- Ys 8 Lacrimosa of Dana
- Zelda Breath of the Wild (Tarrey Town sidequest)
- Xenoblade Chronicles (Colony 6 sidequest)
- Romancing Saga 2 Revenge of the Seven (Avalon city)


However, all of these games aren't quite it - it's not so much a town-building game as it is just a town upgrading system. You don't tend to be able to choose where each new building goes, it just happens in a linear sequence. When you ""max out"" the town upgrades, the final town will look exactly the same as a maxed-out town of every other player on every other playthrough. So there isn't much freedom of expression in the town building.


Here are some games that come even closer to the idea:

- Dragon Quest Builders / Builders 2

It isn't so much a management sim as it is a Minecraft style block-by-block building game. The game does recognise specific rooms depending on which objects you place in them, though, which is fun.
However the issue comes with the fact that, in these games, your home base is only recognised within a tiny 32x32 square of land, and anything you build outside of that ""doesn't count"". There does exist the larger sandbox mode, but there isn't much sim gameplay there, it's mostly a pure sandbox at that point. 


- ActRaiser

This game _does_ feature both action levels and sim levels, however the two don't really interact with each other that much. The only resource you gain in the action levels is score, which has a vague effect on your eventual maximum population in the sim levels, but the correlation isn't really obvious. Plus you can't replay the action levels, so there isn't really a ""gameplay loop"" of gathering -> building -> gathering etc.

The sim system in ActRaiser is extremely basic - even though you get to ""decide"" which direction your town builds in, there really isn't all that much choice at the end of the day - you will want to max out the town by just telling them to build on all available tiles... and, again, all players' endgame towns will end up looking identical to each other. It doesn't quite have the depth I'm looking for.

Thanks guys, I'll be checking some of these out.

Specifically I'm looking for shooters, but any game that fits the criteria is good.

I'm talking about weight gameplay-wise, so killing another person actually feels like a challenge. Too many games, even those that pride themselves on their realism and grittiness, have you slaying hordes and hordes of enemies, so by the end your character racks up a triple digit kill-count. Even games universally loved, like Red Dead Redemption 2, have an unrealistic amount of enemies and superhuman main characters. Every shootout ends up with thirty bodies.

I want a game where the shootouts feel just as challenging, but the amount of bodies laying on the ground at the end of a gunfight is like, 3 or 4, not 40. Smart, accurate AI, and players have just as little health as the enemies, so running and gunning is a total no-go, you have to actually plan out your engagements.

I know there are games with elements like this, or where these are true to certain extents, but there are always just so many enemies to kill anyway.

Compared to renting where its the blatent understanding you do not have full ownership over the item one exchanged currency for. 

I again understand that one is buying the license buts let's be real anybody buying any type of license for a product is basically renting thr product for a 1 time fee or a recurring fee are are not buying anything but rather renting.

gaming,1lu3qfk,Modest proposal for the age of digital gaming: legal rights of game owners,"Many gamers disdain ""pure digital"" games and want physical media. This is understandable as a sense of security and liberty comes with that (the company can't remove the cart from my hands; I can resell it if I want or gift to my kids). But this is untenable as we go into the future.. physical media just doesn't make sense as game balloon in size and are increasingly online-enabled or dependent on regular updates for bug fixes and content.

The real problem is not the medium of physical vs. digital. After all, today, thanks to the internet and related tech, we have far greater access to ancient games than ever before. The problem is the industry and legal status quo is essentially that no protected rights existing for gamers at all, beyond what a publisher feels like offering- which is generally nothing and summarized as ""you gave us $70 so we, of the kindness of our hearts, chose to let you play for a while; but now we decided you can't.""

**Proposal**: When a consumer purchases a digital version of a game, they have legal right to possess and use that game in perpetuity. If the publisher ceases to make the game available for download on its servers by purchasers or ceases operations, that game may be retained by purchasers and legally shared with other purchasers. If the game is online-only and depends on a dedicated server AND the publisher ends its online services for the game, then it becomes legally permissible for third parties to host such servers without permission needed. At the same time, the publisher is absolved of all responsibilities associated with running such a server (security, bugs, etc.) and the third party is ""on their own"".  This should be federal law, not something the publisher has any choice about. 

The benefits of such law is that games do not disappear from history, consumers are able to own products they bought, and there is no undue burden on developers to infinitely support servers that become financially unviable.",0,32,1751917041.0,,0.44,True,False,bad_apiarist,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lu3qfk/modest_proposal_for_the_age_of_digital_gaming/,new,low
gaming,1lu3534,Could we also get some huge initiative about games being released in a poor state?,"With all the attention Stop Killing Games is getting I feel like this would also be a good time to bring up games being released in a “half-assed” state. We’ve seen constantly complaints over the years, from social media to literal memes about Crysis. 

It’s beyond frustrating that we live in a world where games have been poorly optimized and now GPU manufactures created a bandaid fix with frame generation which is exactly what most recent dilemma is Monster Hunter Wilds with the devs solved the issue by turning this on as a solution.

I’m not an organizer for something like his but I’d love to be apart of an organization that finally gets the ball rolling on this topic instead of just meming about it and “dealing with it”. 

What would the end result of this look like? Well clearly games not in a piss poor state upon release for starters, but also that large distributors of games like MS, Sony, Nintendo, Valve and yes even sites like greenmangaming should allow customers to request a refund if the game is in a broken state upon release that goes beyond the 2 hours. While I understand for smaller devs there needs to be some similar but not as harsh rules, this is mainly targeted at larger studios. We all know 2 hours is NOT enough time to really try a game. On average you’re just getting past the tutorial and gathering a baseline of how the game works. 

This also would help with gamers not having to fork over their hard earned money on extremely expensive and limited stock of hardware just to play these games at a “decent” state. We should be living in a world now with the advancements in tech where in order for me to play a AAA game at 60-90fps doesn’t require a current top of the line GPU from any manufacture. We shouldn’t have to wait for a Nintendo switch 2 to FINALLY play original switch titles at their expected performance. 

I would really like to hear from the community what suggestions collectively we could do to start this. I’d like an actual conversation with some sort of ground work. The “vote with your wallet” doesn’t exactly work. It has helped a small handful of times in the last and devs have fixed their games later on, but this shouldn’t even have to be the norm we live in today.

Edit: Amazing the only responses are basically just ""don't buy day 1/pre-order"" which misses the point.

Meanwhile I can easily ignore it and still enjoy the game while others act like the game is ruined over it.

Even in older games before the F2P methods even existed, I never had the desire to grind out for cosmetics. The gameplay itself was enough to carry my interest for years. I guess my brain never left that mentality.

gaming,1ltzykj,I’m sad that we will never see the “Nemesis System” mechanic in a game for a long time.,"Thanks WB.  Closing Monolith that made a couple of games, Shadow of Mordor/War, only to shut them down and patent the mechanic until 2036.   Sure, they could license out the mechanic to another studio if they want to use it, but I doubt that’s going to happen.  

The nemesis system was so unique and instantly made Shadow or Mordor such a unique game that still stands up to this day (more than War, imo).   It’s a shame that we will likely never seen it again especially since the Wonder Woman game was cancelled, as there was word that they were going to implement that mechanic into that game.

They are contributing to the rise of game prices, and doing everything they can to corner people into Game Pass subscription.

Sure, Game Pass may look attractive now. Relatively cheap, access to a huge catalog, cross-platform. 
But look at Netflix 10 years ago vs Netflix now! Netflix 10 years ago was no ads, cheap subscription, huge catalog, good originals and exclusive. Now, every media company has their own platform, the catalog on Netflix is shittier every year, their originals mostly suck or get milked until all the substance is gone, the prices are getting higher and higher, and there are even ads in the lower tier subscription now.

The same thing will happen with Game Pass: It will get more expensive, titles will be removed from it, and the push to have more ""original"" content will favor releasing mediocre quality stuff, done with GenAI so they don't have to pay actual talent.

gaming,1lt4dnc,"Clearing my backlog, I may be some time.","After not really being inspired by the Steam sale, and spending most of the last 2 years mainly playing SoulsBorne games, I have decided to finally put some effort in clearing my backlog, on all platforms, PC (Steam, Epic), PS(5) Xbox (Series X), PSVR and PCVR/Quest. I may be some time.

This is only around 180 games on each platform which is no where near as much as I thought. I am initially focusing on Steam, then Epic, probably look at the other PC storefronts too dependent on how quick I get through it.

Primary goal is finishing the game, reaching the end. Achievements/Trophies are secondary, and completely dependent on how much I enjoy the game as to whether I go hunting.

However, I do 2 rules:

* No account creating. For games that require additional launchers, or third party accounts, if I can play it without creating an account I will do to get a feel for it, otherwise, I will not be playing.
* Only playing games I own. No F&F. My son has bought some real garbage over the years. I may make an exception for Cyberpunk 2077, though.

Also, PCVR will its own section as I prefer to play VR in Winter.

I have already sunk and hour into AdventureQuest 3D (as a quest) this afternoon, I quite enjoyed its simple play style and short quests, so may go back to it afterwards, but who knows. However the overload of puns was a bit daft.

I also ruled out APB Reloaded as it requires creating an account.

So Looks like I am moving on to Assassin's Creed Odyssey. I have already completed this game on PS and Xbox, so should be a quick run through.

I have no plans for streaming or publishing any videos, I may record the raw footage though.

Done FF7 og, FF9 and FF10, hated FF13 and 15 but hardly played them. Picked up 16 and well it’s ok…….but hardly buzzing about playing it again. Love Hades and Slay the Spire but played them to death.

I was diehard for Nethack when it was first coming out. As for souls likes well they are what they are. I suspect if I had been younger when they came out as a phenomenon I would have loved them. By the time soulslike was a thing I just didn't have the reaction speed to get that far into the games. The idea of a corpserun after death just didn't appeal to me, because that would become like a trap. Im not saying I'm the best gamer far from it. What I am saying is that a good part of the gamer population is around my age, and so games tune to the reaction times of prebubescants might be off for the wider audience. Every time I see soulslike in a description of a game I see that its not made for people like me. 

I also don't play free games because those games aren't free and they manipulate difficulty / progression artificially to pressure people to spend money. I just don't want to play a living advertisement that I know is always trying to manipulate me.

The game industry now caters to the (hardcore) gamer and that's just not me. When you combine a rougelike and a soulslike that is always increasing in difficulty Im never going to finish that game.

My friends played it too, and some of our best mutual memories from that time come from our countless hot seat matches. However, one guy in our group of friends was a bit overly competitive, so playing anything with him could (and often would) turn into a non-fun activity. This one time we ended up at my place at crazy hours after a night out and decided to play a hot seat match of HoMM 3, after which he would go home, and I would go to sleep. Great idea, right? So, the game took about an hour or more, before I got him cornered in the last battle, with stronger army than his. He was in a hopeless situation, so I almost expected him to surrender and then quickly leave my place so I could finally get some sleep, and what ... he ... does ... is ... RETREAT!

- ""Why not? The option is right there.""

gaming,1lrmcaa,You should be grateful Xbox is falling apart and here is why,"The idea behind the Game Pass is basically the same as what Epic Games is doing with its free games:
engage users and create value within the platform through progress, achievements, and ownership inside the ecosystem, encouraging them to stay (ideally exclusively) in their system.

And this is perfectly normal for any corporation. - to aggressively “buy” users with free content, because in the long run, when they conquer the market, they will profit from all those acquisition investments.

Of course, this was the only option for acquiring all publishers: to make us quit Steam, Epic, PlayStation, literally everything else.

The problems begin only when you think about what happens next, when this strategy succeeds and we all live in the happy Microsoft ecosystem, playing all these “free” games.

The thing is, Microsoft is a public company and must generate more revenue every year to be considered successful. And there is only one way to do this in the long run: cut the content of base games included in the subscription, and move more and more content into paid DLC, in-game purchases, and other predatory practices.

gaming,1lrkvo1,"If survival horror games were made the way they used to be, could they look photo-realistic?","Games like resident evil used to let players move on a 3 dimensional plane, but with fixed camera angles. They were like semi-3d.

They usually had janky controls, and maybe it made sense for how the game was designed. Obviously nobody would accept those controls in 2025 so let's say they have fixed that.

With today's hardware, could they make a game like that look like real life? Since they have tighter control over what you see and do, they don't have to worry about what angle you view something at or how close you are to a texture.

In those games, you mostly walked around small rooms so you only worried about loading the next room as needed. Even for outside areas you were limited to a specific path.

Think of a game like fatal frame that is 2d when roaming around but full 3d when you are in camera mode. I feel like the ghosts and jump scares could look like movie quality. Yes the gameplay for such a game isn't likely to be as good as playing one of the remakes, but must from a presentation standpoint it should be better, right?

How good could a game like that look? Would you want to play it (assuming it controlled better than a game from 1998)?",11,31,1751641288.0,,0.6,True,False,lilb1190,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lrkvo1/if_survival_horror_games_were_made_the_way_they/,new,low
gaming,1lrkna5,It’s Now or Never for Banjo Threeie,"
With Microsoft’s cancellation of Everwild and Perfect Dark, Rare’s team and their IPs are at risk of becoming irrelevant.

I can see Perfect Dark struggling to find an audience in the flooded FPS market, but Banjo is a beloved character that Microsoft has failed to capitalize on.

And time is running out.

Banjo is beloved to the kids of the 90s, who spent countless hours collecting in Rare’s wonderfully crafted worlds. Most of these kids are now adults, with their own kids. 

The current generation may not be as familiar with Banjo but their parents are, and they’ll likely purchase it to play with them. But this window of time is coming to a close, soon adults born after the initial N64 games will be having kids and they won’t have the same nostalgic attachment. 

Microsoft and Rare need to maintain their IP and reintroduce Banjo to a new generation before he becomes a lost relic of retro gaming.

Once I passed the >!Plate Gate!< for the first time into >!Australia!< I skipped the ship & set out with what I had on me to explore the map for prepper stations. Extra blood bags, a pistol & a few grenades.

It has turned into one of the best open world exploration experiences I've ever played.

It suddenly feels like a survival game being so far away from a terminal & having to forage for resources. To have to be careful & manage my stamina or sneaking into bases for items.

And to see the landscapes for the first time unmarked by others (or me for that matter) makes for some epic views. Like being in Blade Runner movie.

It also kinda feels like playing Shadow of the Colossus on steroids, in a way.

I'd highly recommend it in exploring the map for the first time.

Let yourself be the weird nerd dude at the party like Scott Pilgrim talking about Pac-Man. No matter if it’s something long or short, just something you like and want to share. I’ll start with something easy:

In Xenoblade Chronicles 2 there’s a gacha system (no micro transactions) with which you pull blades to fight with. One of these blades is called KOS-MOS, and is one of the strongest blades available. Being as strong as she is, there’s only a 0.1% drop chance. It’s so hard to get some people have farmed the item needed to pull blades for hundreds of hours and still have had no luck at all to get her.

Well, during my second play through I got her pretty early in the game. To this day I think I still don’t comprehend how lucky that actually was. Played with her for the entire game and enjoyed my play through a ton. But there is a huge downside to this, and I guess it’s something every person who got her have. The game only allows a single save slot. There’s NG+ with the ability to start from level 1 and all. But I would really like to start a fresh run from scratch, without having money, gear, blades, etc. and at the same time I don’t want to lose my KOS-MOS save. So the only possible solution is to create a new account on the switch, but I don’t really feel like it.",94,217,1751546227.0,,0.83,True,False,usedNecr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lqohsk/explain_the_most_useless_fact_you_know_of_a_game/,new,low

From the very first level, it’s clear that this is a big step up from the original Pac-Man World, with tighter controls, more colorful and varied environments, and a level design that focuses more on action and movement. Each world has its own visual and musical identity, from lush forests and underwater caves to icy peaks and spooky valleys, and the game does a good job introducing new mechanics like ice sliding, swimming, or wall jumping to keep things fresh. Pac-Man’s movement feels snappy and satisfying, and abilities like the butt bounce and the rev roll are fun to use, adding a nice layer of personality to the platforming. The rev roll in particular gives the gameplay a sense of speed and momentum that helps distinguish it from other mascot platformers of the era. That said, not everything has aged perfectly. The camera can be clunky, especially in tight spaces or underwater sections where it doesn’t always follow the action well, leading to some frustrating deaths. Later levels sometimes rely too much on trial and error, with sudden falls and bottomless pits that feel more cheap than challenging. The collectible system can be addictive if you’re a completionist, but also annoying if you realize you missed a fruit at the start of a long level and need to replay the whole thing. Despite these issues, the game has a lot of charm. The soundtrack is catchy, the boss battles have a simple arcade-style fun, and including the original Pac-Man game as an unlockable extra is a great nod to the series’ roots. Overall, Pac-Man World 2 is a colorful and underrated 3D platformer that may show its age at times, but still delivers a fun and memorable experience with a lot of heart.

gaming,1lqbpfc,Which tropes or mechanics do you think are overdone in the RTS genre? And what's something you'd like to see in an RTS that you don't see much of?,"Hello peeps! I'm working on a little side project of mine, making an RTS in Godot based around some worldbuilding and art concept I've developed in the last few years, and while I wouldn't want to get completely sidestepped by outside input I am curious how I could make mine stand out (provided it ever sees the light of day).

I myself grew up playing Panzers Codename 1 and 2, Age of Empires 3, Africa Korp VS Desert Rats, Man of War, Battle for Middle Earth and... I guess Spore's civilization stage technically counts? And in recent years I've enjoyed playing Stellaris, Iron Harvest, and to a lesser degree HOI4. So those are currently my frames of reference, and particularly I've always liked the inclusion of heroe characters on the map, since it's an easy tool for diving into storytelling and exposition. I do like the customization side some of these games offer for your units as well, while something I kinda dislike is how games like HOI4 have just so much stuff to keep track of to the point combat itself seems to take a step to the side. Oh, and something I also enjoy is being able to take control of individual units like in Man of War. But regardless, I'm curious to hear any input if you'd like to share, so thank you in advance :)",1,32,1751501918.0,,0.52,True,False,RaptarK,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lqbpfc/which_tropes_or_mechanics_do_you_think_are/,new,low

Hogwarts was CLOSE but I still think we need a great game where you are more than just a wizard with a gun wand shooting frost, fire, and lightning. I love the magic system in WoW but I want a good story game

I want a game that has a ton of just unique spells that interact with the world. That's the fun part of imaging being a wizard. I want to be able to pull water out of the river and turn it into ice for a bridge, or throw it at people. I want to be able to summon familiars, or use a spell to disguise myself to look super old or young. 

I feel like there ARE a ton of games that have these mechanics, but it doesn't encapsulate the wide berth of magic that we see in the fantasy world at large. It's usually just a small slice of magic. Trine and Trine 2 comes to mind, with the way you use magic to solve puzzles. 

But I want my combat to be more than just lasers out of a wand. Let me summon a giant fire tornado, or a massive snake.

This user is also given the opportunity to know that this game may shut down fully (fully meaning they wouldn't have to do any end of life support, wouldn't have to release the server files, etc) for any reason (or maybe more accurately after some final month to ensure their last fee wasn't completely wasted) before any point of purchase of their subscription, I wouldn't be able to do this? Specifically completely shut down my own game, and not have to release any part of it afterwards. Or maybe this still would be allowed and I'm misunderstanding something, but anyway...

With all that said, it seems like many people have mention a few things.

1. ""Why would someone ever want their own work destroyed?"" - To that, I don't really see why someone else's desire or reason to do whatever they want to their own work should be questioned, or at most stopped. It's their work, if they currently own it / have possession of it, etc, by all means, let them do whatever they want to it.

2. ""What if someone came into your home to destroy your TV, book, painting, etc?"" - This analogy doesn't work with an online game, or more accurately, the permission to access information that lives on a server from your client. I can understand yeah, if you bought something fully (as with an mmo you aren't purchasing the entire full stack environment) you now own that thing, and tough luck for the creator to try and do anything about it.

3. ""Why wouldn't they just be able to release the game's server data, they're not using it anymore, etc? - Similar to point 1, they don't have to, and there might be good reason, say some game rework, wanting to make something for a limited time only, etc. Sure, it would be nice to release everything, as it would continue on whatever they've made and people could continue to play something they enjoy, but again, it's something they shouldn't be enforced to do, in any manner. (Also note: in some cases server code might be source code itself, as with some of my online games, SKG has mentioned source code wouldn't need to be released, and I could wrap code in some obfuscation, or some other method, but I would disagree that their initiative should dictate how I write my server code, which leads back to what their initiative kind of boils down to anyway...)

Keep in mind I don't even live in the region where this is being proposed, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of everything. And I'm not trying to ""attack"" or just discredit the SKG movement as I would also like every single game to be preserved. I love games and have spent probably too much of my life playing them. But I run into this issue in my head about if some creator wanted to shut down access to their game, who am I to be able to do anything about it? I'm not entitled to their IP, and what money I've spent on it doesn't cover any ownership over what was running on the server. Sure, maybe this is exactly what SKG is trying to do, and I would have to disagree with it due to removing the ability of choice for some creator who may just want their creations to be shut down for whatever reason they may have.",0,49,1751475252.0,,0.24,True,False,Lunarcomplex,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lq10za/trying_to_understand_skg_why_shouldnt_a_creator/,new,low

gaming,1lpzvr5,why has there been such a massive amount of misinformation around the switch 2?,"i know this is r/gaming so this is probably going to be giga downvoted and i’m gonna be accused of bootlicking the billion dollar corporation or whatever, but i really can’t wrap my head around how there’s been so much easily disprovable misinformation around the switch 2

and i understand, nintendo does a lot of questionable things like being debatably TOO protective of their ip and things of that nature, but people have legitimately just been making things up or lying to make it seem worse

but like 

1. “$80 games are the standard now” just not true. this MIGHT be subject to change, so we’ll say this is the weakest point, but at the time of writing, it’s literally only mario kart. and whether you agree or disagree, mario kart world is a game people are going to be playing for a decade if the last game is any indicator. if there’s any game that COULD even theoretically justify a higher price for the amount of value you’re going to get from it over time, mario kart is certainly one of the few. any of the “$80” switch 2 editions of games like tears of the kingdom and kirby are effectively just a $70 and $60 game with a $10 and $20 dlc, and donkey kong is $70. we can criticize not making the base price of the older games lower so that a $10 or $20 dlc doesn’t bring it up to $80, but that’s different from $80 being “standard”. 

2. “physical games are more expensive than digital” there is no evidence to suggest that this is true in any sort of widespread capacity. the only source to this claim was a single website that i haven’t even seen any follow-ups on, but even on the tiny chance that it is true, it’s just for that singular region and not something new

3. “nintendo changed their EULA so they can brick your console for no reason whenever they want”. for one, this is language that is similar across all console manufacturers from the moment consoles were consistently connected to the internet all the way back to the wii/ps3 era. this is not a new nor a uniquely nintendo concept. secondly, they do not brick your console, they restrict it from accessing any online features is they detect or suspect things like piracy. again, this is not new, console manufacturers of all brands have been doing this for years. one of the first things you would hear back in the day if you wanted to mod a 3ds was “make sure you do NOT connect to the internet on the modded console” for exactly this reason. you can still play your physical games just fine (which leads to the next point), the console is FAR from “bricked”

4. “physical games are dead all the games are basically just codes in boxes”. this is entirely on third parties, and, once again also not new or unique to nintendo. the newest doom, for example, is not fully on disc and requires an internet download. and even then, at the time of writing, all first party nintendo games and nintendo switch 2 editions of older first party games are all fully on cart with all content, no internet needed. cyberpunk on switch 2 is also fully on cart, demonstrating that it IS possible and this is a conscious decision from developers. i’ve heard that the larger carts are a bit more expensive to produce, but, just like everyone constantly says about nintendo, these are almost all multibillion dollar corporations and publishers, they can afford to print the more expensive carts. until a first party nintendo game is released as a game key-card, this is not a complaint to leverage at nintendo specifically 

and i’m sure there might be a few more i’m not remembering right now 

all of these are things that take like 5 seconds of googling or just using your eyes to see that they’re not true, but a month later i’m still seeing tons of people peddling these myths as if they’re unquestionable fact. some of it is definitely the fault of the gaming publications reporting dubious unsubstantiated claims, not doing their due diligence by fact checking before publishing, but that’s only up to a point. eventually it’s on us to do our own research and confirm information",0,70,1751472562.0,,0.41,True,False,brando-boy,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lpzvr5/why_has_there_been_such_a_massive_amount_of/,new,low
gaming,1lpz0ga,Fallout 4,"I understand that the fallout series is very beloved. I am a recent return to console gaming (last 2 years) and my last console being a ps2. I have been playing up as many older beloved games as I can get my hands on to catch up on gaming experiences I missed. 

I just started Fallout 4, and I don’t plan to quit it just yet but usually within an hour of gameplay a game will grab my interest.

gaming,1lpy7lm,Death Stranding 1 & 2 are the closest games to a real journey I've played,"I've toured as a roadie for months on end. 

The first time was grueling. Difficult. Tested me in ways I didn't forsee. The glamour wears off pretty quick when you haven't showered in 5 days, have gotten little sleep and still have to drive 8 hours to the next city. 

You know how Sam just plops down and passes out when he rests in a private room? That's pretty much how it is when you can afford a motel for a night. I didn't know what to expect. Didn't know what to bring. 

Kinda like Death Stranding 1.

The tradeoff is seeing country you've never seen. Food you've never eaten. Landscapes that are just gorgeous. I still remember the shadow of a mountain stretching across the plains one early morning. 

The 2nd time I toured for months was way easier. More streamlined. I knew what to bring (flushable wipes!), knew what to expect, knew how to manage myself. I knew how to organize our cargo, how to better deal with the road.

Kinda like Death Stranding 2.

So the closest games I've personally played that mimick that sense of travel, evolution & accomplishment are these games.

And if you ever get the opportunity to travel, take it. There's nothing quite so humbling as being a stranger in a strange land.

gaming,1lpvenc,Microsoft Begins Deep Job Cuts Across Xbox Division,"[Microsoft Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/MSFT:US)'s gaming division began informing employees of job cuts on Wednesday morning, initiating the process of widespread layoffs that staff have been expecting for the last week.  
  
\- Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes *Candy Crush*, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs, according to people familiar with the plans. 

\- Other European offices, such as ZeniMax, also began informing employees that job cuts were happening, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to press.  
  
US units were expected to be told later Wednesday how many jobs would be cut at each office. Microsoft's gaming division had about 20,000 employees as of January 2024.  
  
Employees had been bracing for the job cuts since May, when Microsoft began conducting companywide layoffs and speculation mounted that the gaming division might be impacted. Many staff learned last week through a Bloomberg report that the cuts were imminent.

Every world is completely unique and set up in a way that rewards you for exploring. You can 100% the game without really ever needing to tap into a walkthrough or videos - the game just is so open and gives you so many different ways to explore.

There's just so many things that the game does perfectly. The characters and dialogue are so creative with even side characters having memorable moments and being endearing. The music is absolutely fantastic, and the way you earn new abilities as you explore new worlds feels like such a natural progression system. The morphs and the added castle secrets just add more and more layers on what is already such a wonderful gameplay experience.

As if the game wasn't good enough already, it drops the best world in any collectathon game Click Clock Wood, which is a forest world you explore across four seasons.

gaming,1lp2pip,Decline in Gaming Technology?,"Obviously certain things have made great strides, like graphics, over the past ten years.

But in some ways it seems like game engines or tech have declined. I'll focus on the shooter genre because that's where I really notice it.

Battlefield 3 came out in 2011 and had pretty robust destructible environments and supported quite large battles with lots of vehicles going at once.

Same can be said for Planetside 2 being able to support massive battles with tons of effects at this time, just has another example.

Now 14 years later, barely any shooters seem to include destructible environments or massive scale battles.

For example, Arma Reforger recently introduced terrain destruction, but it's not even halfway to realism of Battlefield 3, a game released in 2011, in this sense.

Is the industry losing its touch with some of this tech? Or is it just because all shooters are cartoon battle royale copy pastes now?

gaming,1loykx6,Would you be against blocking messages to minors being standard practice in most games where you make an account?,"https://preview.redd.it/xd5tsbd1s8af1.png?width=1102&format=png&auto=webp&s=83a6dfb422f97c0eea11586bbb851f2515c33297

I suppose I should open this by saying I haven’t played *Persona 5: The Phantom X*, and maybe I’m late to the party, but I read today that the game actively blocks accounts that claim to be over 18 from privately messaging accounts registered as under 18. I just had the biggest “Huh, this should probably be standard practice” moment.

I can only think of three logical concerns people might raise:

1. **What if you turn 18 and all your friends are 16–17?** In that case, maybe a video game private chat shouldn’t be your main method of communication—or perhaps accounts could recognize active friendships and allow messaging with users who were already connected before the age threshold.
2. **Kids shouldn’t be playing age-rated games anyway, or minors could be lying about their age.** To which I’d say…sure, but if you want access to 18+ features, you could choose to opt out of these protections at your own risk, rather than having no guardrails at all.
3. **Predators could just make accounts registered as under 18.** That’s a valid concern, but if accounts claiming to be minors are behaving inappropriately with other minors, that actually makes it easier to flag and identify those individuals. It removes the common “I didn’t know how young they were” excuse and helps platforms hold people accountable.

I’m curious to hear how everyone would feel if this sort of system suddenly became the universal standard on services like Steam, Xbox Live, and PlayStation Network.",663,338,1751367269.0,,0.84,True,False,British_Historian,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1loykx6/would_you_be_against_blocking_messages_to_minors/,new,medium

gaming,1lote3j,"Vent: Less time I have for gaming, more I buy and analyse my collection","Allright, so I was always ""smart"" gamer in that regard, that I was buying only those games I was going to play in the near  future, ideally immediately. 

Once we had our children, I basically stopped buying games and played only those from my backlog (I have PS+, so naturally some backlog is created after some time). I had few purchases, but mostly I played them right away.  

So far so good, but last few months I started to feel that I miss playing games more. You know, one of those periods, when you want dive deeper into given hobby. But I am not able to... 

My children are going to bed later and later (9 pm) and me and my wife want to spend some time together. So I have only some playing time with my kids (0.5 h per day aprox.), with my wife (she plays with me few games, or watch me play, but its not here first choice of hobby, so its like once per week), or late in the evening when everybody went to sleep, but you guess it, I fall asleep after one hour or so, and this one hour of gaming isnt the best either because I am tired.

Now to get to the point of this post: I keep constantly thinking about games, but I am not able to enjoy them properly. Dont get me wrong, I love playing games with my kids, but I also wanna some solo gaming sessions, those are much different (different games, different immersion etc). 

So instead of gaming I make purchases, I read reviews and I am managing my backlog, giving each game I have priority order, writing down time needed to complete given game etc. only to not be able to play those games in the first place (I do those thing at work or at phone). And its really exhausting.

gaming,1lor5s0,Something occurred to me today about gaming: it is one of the few truly shared cultural experiences left,"Bear with me. As a 90s kid I was lamenting the loss of things like Saturday morning TV shows where almost every kid in the country would come to school the following Monday having seen the same shows and skits and have that shared cultural experience. Even at the time we would often be watching it with our siblings whereas now kids are isolated to an individual screen consuming fragmented short form content that their friends will likely never be aware of let alone discuss/minic/riff on together.

It seems like the only medium that still has a very strong sense of a shared cultural experience where we are all still mostly consuming or at least aware of, and discussing, the same content is gaming.

For all the negativity we have around eg. The AAA space at least it’s a kind of shared cultural narrative that we are all a part of in some way. I have no idea what people are reading or watching or listening to anymore but I know we’re all here arguing over the graphics of new Pokemon games and freaking out at the latest from some venerated gaming icon like Kojima etc.

Kind of comforting in a way. I’m not sure if gaming will ever become as fragmented as other media, I wonder why? I don’t think it’s just that it’s harder to make games so there’s less choice, I think it might be 1) because talking about it is half the fun and 2) because gamers are honestly some of the biggest snobs around (and I think that’s great, quality - even our subjective perception of it - matters).",0,23,1751339370.0,,0.31,True,False,LaCaipirinha,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lor5s0/something_occurred_to_me_today_about_gaming_it_is/,new,low

gaming,1lopelh,What Are Your Experiences Trying To Get Non-Gamers Into Gaming?,"Hey everyone, in the past I'd tried on multiple occasions to get my parents into games, and it resulted in a lot of failed attempts but every now and then I still get the urge to try again with the logic that maybe I just hadn't been picking games that'd be suitable to their sensibilities. These are some examples of my mom's experiences:

**Persona 4 Golden** \- Right off the bat it probably was not the best idea to start off with a JRPG, as on top of how deep mechanics can get, she couldn't fathom how a video game could be 70+ hours long. She liked the country town setting but quickly got bored by the long intro segment and I don't think she could really take it all that seriously because of the anime aesthetic.  At the time I just wanted to share something I'd enjoyed with her, but I'm actually glad she didn't continue because of the ""fanservice-y"" stuff in the game and one of the dungeons for>!a 15yr old character being a literal strip club...!<

**Breath of the Wild** \- I thought the sort of ""sandbox"" aspect of it would lend itself well to someone getting acclimated, but again she quickly got bored, this time's reasoning being that having so much freedom and only having vague reminders of what she ""should"" be doing instead of having more straightforward progression made it feel like her exploration and actions didn't really mean anything, so she gave up within the hour. Interesting how what many consider the game's biggest strength was a sour spot for someone not very familiar with the medium.

**Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** \- I figured she'd like this one for the multiplayer aspect, but she couldn't get a good grip on the controls and it requiring constant action from the player was just a bit too much for her. Although she kept bumping into walls she didn't want the handicaps like smart steering on either, so we moved onto Smash Ultimate.

**Smash Ultimate** \- I'm surprised that she actually enjoyed her time with this one. Compared to Mario Kart I'd always considered Smash the much more complex of the two but she seemed to get the gist pretty quickly, and despite not knowing who a good chunk of the roster was she liked how many characters there were to choose from because it never made matches feel stale.

**Undertale** \- Despite also being an RPG, compared to a traditional one I felt it was lighter on the mechanics side and I figured she'd at least find some charm in the characters and writing. This one had a bit more going on so I'll bullet it:  
  
\- The simplistic graphics and a lack of voice acting for all that text seemed to be an innate barrier that made it hard for her to get immersed.   
  
\- She never had a great sense of direction in the ruins, so she'd often exit a room only to walk right back into it thinking she was entering a new one and be confused why she wasn't making progress.

\- The battle system confused her, as she didn't see much point to adding extra steps by using the act commands and sparing when she could just kill the enemies, and also wasn't great at dodging enemy attacks  
  
\- Because she kept getting lost, she'd naturally trigger a lot of random encounters which frustrated her because she didn't understand why the same enemies she had ""beaten already"" kept appearing

I remember her seeing Sans and Papyrus, so we made it out of the ruins but I don't remember if I might've helped her or took over at some point because she got too annoyed. Regardless, she didn't seem to want to play again.

But anyways, this might've been a loaded read, but feel free to share your own experiences or advice as well!

Only two people were interested. The rest didn’t care because it didn’t give them in-game currency or help their grind. That’s wild to me.

gaming,1lntyv1,Pockets of Gaming Glory,"Just randomly thinking today while in the kitchen that each era of gamers born got to have their prime year experiences with certain online games and no other generation before or after will be able to experience it. 

Like I was born in 1993 and I got to play xbox live when it first came out and play Halo 2 with everyone that was likely around my era. Glitching by sword canceling out of the map on Gemini with 15 online strangers is something that wont happen for anyone born 2000s and after. Only the generation that were probably ages 11-35 at that time got to experience it. Then into playing Halo 3 online and having so many moments. 

 Then you get older, start a family and have a responsibility. All the while new online games are coming out and a younger generation is playing these online games in their prime gaming years cementing memories of their favorite games that just happen to be big in that era (fortnite, roblox, etc). 


So they wouldnt understand the feeling of super bouncing on lockout, doing the elevator glitch on call of duty 2, playing offline multiplayer on Time Splitters 2 etc. 

And only the group that was playing these games in their prime will have that connection and understanding when talking about these games. Its like a special bond we have from the era we grew up playing in. And each generation will have their own.

  I dont know its just a random thought and I wanted to share. My son is 2 now and I hope during his prime years are some great games he can make memories with friends.

gaming,1lnlike,So I had a realization when it comes to Shooters-Valorant-Siege-cs-etc,"So first a small bit of context. I play a lot of shooters, even the bad ones, a game a really didn’t touch or play often was Valorant. I found the game to be just too toxic, terribly un-optimized, and just over all bad for my mental health. Recently a friend group of mine along with some co-workers, had gotten me into the game proper and while there are some gripes  I still have, I’ve been having a lot of fun thanks for to my friends being with me. but because of this playing Valorant made me come to this realization due to some of the skins and bundles that have come out over the past year.

SOUND EFFECTS/ GUNSHOTS MATTER. 

I’m not even referring to the fact that you need good sound effects to make the gameplay more engaging and satisfying for player, though that is another reason you should. 

What I’m talking about here is that the sounds can actively make you a better player. If you the sounds of the guns are weak too fast,or don’t really sound that good and can create a sub conscious feeling of the gun being light and quick which; in turn will mess you up and you’ll lose most gun fights. I took a pretty heavy note in Valorant of the default skins and guns sounds are… ok, but when I find players who are doing really well(my friends included) usually remark that it’s when they use a certain skin. 
I realized this has to be because of the sound effects the skins that people like and do better with have a heavy, chunkier, powerful sound which I think leads people to be more cautious and accurate. 

“Ok” you might be wondering “what about other games like Cs or Siege like you mentioned?” Well for Cs it’s because they had the sound effect down already wanting it to sound realistic, almost like the same feeling when some one hears a really satisfying sound/ garand ping, they’ll want to better with that gun just to get that sound. When it comes to siege, a lot of people’s top pick operators will also relate to the gun like the MP5 for doc or Smoke’s shotgun, siege can also get away slightly with slightly different sounding guns because it’s aided by the destructible environment, Lesion’s suppressed shotgun may not Feel or sound strong but when you’re blasting massive holes and dry wall that compensates. 


TLDR: Having satisfying sounds for your guns and make you a better player. 


Let me know what you guys think, and do you have any games where you especially the love the sounds of the weapons? Really love to know some thoughts on this

Besides, if its anything like DS1 you won't even be touching the ground by the end of it. I started doing foot deliveries in the post-game of DS1 because I started to miss the treks.

Not sure how to put words on this. 

There is a whole aesthethic in sci fi landscape during the 90's , early 2000 that is so special to me. 

I am currently playing KOTOR 2, and this saga is so special in its atmosphere. The Star Wars universe helps a lot of course, but there is something in those landscape. To me they feel comfortable, nostalgic and kinda strange. In Dantooine KOTOR, the mix of the minimalistic natural landscape, with some sci fi details such as a speeder that is parked around a tree, a farmhouse with grass on its top, the flying stringray above the landscape.... It just give me this ""wow"" feeling. 

I say ""nostalgic"" but I never played those game when they were released. I dont have any particular connection to them. Yet, thats how they make me feel.

I am craving for games like those. Maybe there is some modern equivalent, but I think AAA graphics are not compatible with this feeling. Maybe in some indie titles ? 

 I am sorry if this is very vague, I am bad at puting words on my feelings. I hope you will still understand what I am trying to describe here. 

Thank you for reading :)

gaming,1ln488c,I'm starting to understand why people criticize Stellar Blade,"I'm about 23 hours in and I think the honeymoon phase is over. First of all, 7 hours worth of side content in between Alpha Naytibas is way too much. I am a completionist and loot goblin at heart. I like to check behind every corner for crates and people, I always go in the opposite direction of the objective, and I like to do all available side missions and puzzles to give me an edge. I was certainly overgeared and over specced after doing everything before heading off to Matrix 11. It allowed me to beat Tachy in only 2 tries, which was nice, but now I've experienced another 7 hrs of quests before I can head to the 3rd Naytiba. And to what end? I'm already extremely overgeared/ specced from the first round.  
Combat is cheese. When I first unlocked the beta skills and ranged I thought they were a little OP and didn't want to use them because it would make the game too easy. But now I find myself cheesing every fight because if I don't I just won't make progress in a timely fashion. The dodge is extremely unreliable, and barely moves Eve. The combos don't work half the time, and neither do the counter attacks/ blink skills. The parry is the only thing that works well, which is unfortunate because it has a health bar (shield). I shamelessly stock WB pumps because I know every time I die it's because the enemy cheesed me before I could cheese him.  
I was extremely hyped about this game when it hit PC and thought for sure I would happily rate it a 9/10 or 10/10. But the way I'm feeling now it's slowly sliding to the 4-6/10 range. I know someone is going to respond to my first paragraph by saying, ""you don't have to do the side quests,"" and someone is going to respond to the second paragraph by saying, ""skill issue.""  
 Overall, when you get over the gooner honeymoon this game is kinda ass actually. I didn't have any issues beating Jedi on Grandmaster because that game actually responded to your inputs. This game just feels extremely unresponsive from a combat perspective.

gaming,1lmmdjb,Genre Bending,"The Mario franchise is an example of a franchise that crosses over to numerous gaming genres frequently- from racing, to platforming, to sports and beyond. 

But, Mario is an easy franchise to adapt to multiple genres due to the very light hearted and imaginative nature of the games.

What do you think would be a good franchise to crossover to different Genres, in a way that actually makes sense and fits the story/universe to some extent?

One example of mine would be a Resident Evil fighting game. The story would be that the main characters are a team of specialists investigating more reports of T-Virus shenanigans in another remote area of the planet.

They get captured, and learn that a secretive cult is using heavily modified strains of the virus to enhance physical abilities of humans, to various degrees of effect and success. Not trying to create total abominations, but merely enhance the “human experience”. 

They test their “super soldiers” in what is essentially cage fighting, and now that they’ve gotten their hands on a crew of highly trained and skilled bio-terror specialists, they can *really* put their creations to the test. 

What results is a somewhat traditional side-view fighting game, but heavily dosed with story and cinematics. You have to try to survive the fights with your crew of 8, and you get different endings depending on how many of your crew are left by the end. 

Of course, at some point things go off the rails and instead of just a cage fight, there will be a side-scrolling escape segment where you use everything you’ve learned so far to escape the facility, quick-swapping between whatever crew members remain alive to fight through generic goons as enhanced warriors alike.

I don’t know. Maybe this is stupid as hell but I feel like RE is a good franchise to expand into different genres.

gaming,1lm16o2,I Made an Essential Games List for My Console Newbie Coworker. How did I do? What should I change?,"I recently began trying to introduce my younger coworker to the joys of retro gaming, and when he told me he didn’t know where to start I decided to make a little cheat-sheet of some of the most essential game experiences out there. I had so much fun with it, I ended up turning it into a whole big thing where I touch on pretty much every notable console/handheld/arcade machine.

In order to give him the most rounded selection I could, I made some constraints for myself.

1. Only one entry per series per console. So, no including both Sonic 2 and 3 for the Genesis list, even though both are deserving. It also means no Majora’s Mask, whomp whomp. Sequels were fine if they were on other platforms.

2. No duplicate entries across all lists. For instance, Chrono Trigger will not show up on the DS list, because it’s on the SNES one.

3. For games with multiple iterations, like ports, multiplatform releases, remasters, etc, I tended to either pick the original for it’s importance (like RE4), or for the best-playing experience (like Wind Waker HD), based on which one I felt was more significant. If you see something important missing, check at the bottom to see if the Arcade version is listed.

On that note, this is not a Top-10 “Best” Games list, or even a Top-10 Personal Favorites list. It’s also not a ranked list, the relative placement of a game means nothing. It’s meant for the specific purpose of giving someone a solid foundation for any given consoles library. I chose games based on critical reception, popularity, cultural significance, industry impact, exclusivity, and uniqueness. This means that a lot of essential and classic games get left out, but it’s also WIP so any feedback is appreciated! Especially any of those true retro platforms that some people might be super invested in! It’s the reason I’m posting after all.

Also, if this is not an appropriate subreddit I will delete! I’m just looking for places that allow general games discussion posts.

gaming,1llxz6u,"I host a bunch of game wikis (OSRS, Minecraft) that got way better when they escaped from Fandom's terrible platform. What other wikis do you wish could get away?","Hey /r/gaming! I help run [Weird Gloop](https://weirdgloop.org), which is a group of RuneScape wiki nerds that specializes in un-enshittifying wikis by getting them away from Fandom’s insanely bad ad experience, and giving control back to the wiki editors that are actually doing all the work.

We started off in 2018 by moving the RuneScape/OSRS wikis to [runescape.wiki](https://runescape.wiki), which became (afaik) the first wiki fork to overwhelmingly beat out the abandoned Fandom version on Google. [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki) followed about 2 years ago, and since then we've been doing a bunch of official wikis ([League of Legends](https://wiki.leagueoflegends.com), [Warframe](https://wiki.warframe.com), [Vampire Survivors](https://vampire.survivors.wiki)) directly with the game developers (surprise, game devs don't like the Fandom ads anymore than you do…)

Even putting aside the dogshit ads, it's crazy just how much **better** all of those wikis got after they moved away from Fandom. The quality of the actual wiki content goes up in a noticeable, measurable way ([here](https://weirdgloop.org/blog/why-were-helping-more-wikis-move-away-from-fandom#why-ditching-fandom-is-cool-and-based)'s some fun graphs), because more people show up and want to help, when they feel like they're contributing to something that isn't taking advantage of them.

A bunch of the wikis we ended up hosting got the ball rolling because of people on game subreddits venting about Fandom ([here](https://reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1ixysva/discussion_on_changing_wiki_hosts_away_from_fandom/)’s a conversation on /r/balatro, which launched at [balatrowiki.org](https://balatrowiki.org) just last week).

gaming,1llpxm9,Ok hear me out. Are there any full releases that have management gameplay similar to Umamusume?,"I feel the need to preface this post with the following statement. The premise of Umamusume is absurd and goofy af. That said, the game does a shit ton of stuff right, and I'm looking for a full title that can scratch the same itch because I've legitimately never really played anything like this before.

So I started playing Umamusume on a whim because I saw a video of their race presentation and it seemed pretty fun to drop in casually. Little did I realize getting into it that the game has what is actually an insanely deep management sim with a shit ton of build possibilities. Unfortunately the depth of the game is pretty strongly gated behind gacha and grinding is gated behind stamina systems as well.

The overall gameplay is actually fun and rewarding enough for me to want a full title with the same gameppay loop. It's a roguelike training sim. The way it works is that you pick a horse to start a run with and you out them through the training system with specific deadlines at which you need to perform in races in order to continue the run and ultimately become the horse race champion. Yes it's absurd, but it's weirdly addicting. 

The training options you have are static, but their outcomes can be effected by a deck of support cards that randomly cause certain events to occur that offer boosts and unlock new skills to learn. When a run ends either in failure or in triumph, you're given a token that represents the horse you trained that is then able to pass on skills and attributes to the next horse you want to start a run with. You will ultimately have two generations of horses, grandparents, and parents, that all contribute to your ""ultimate horse"" and that horse can just continue being used when you generate new horses. It is literally a horse breeding system.

I have become obsessed with Umamusume, but all the gacha elements of the game prevent me from being able to play it on my terms so now I'm desperately looking for an actually standalone game that offers something similar. Please help. It doesn't have to be about horses and it doesn't have to have anime visuals.

* Video game adaptation of a board game that eventually led to a 9-book series
   * 6 are currently available, the other 3 coming soon.
   * Stories are similar to Pixar / Dreamwork films: aimed at kids, but also enjoyable for older readers
* Developed by French-Canadian indie studio RuniQ
   * The original series is also French-Canadian.
* Currently available on Steam, with a Switch version possibly coming in September, according to the devs
* Both **coop**erative and **comp**etitive multiplayer, with challenges, races, survival, all with items to hamper your opponents
* The characters can transform into dragons, with powerful breath weapons and screen-clearing attacks
* Slight RPG elements, with equipable items
* 4 characters to start with, 4 others to come in the future
   * Personally, that's a *little* annoying, because the splash art shows all 8 Heroes.
   * It could be to avoid spoiling the books.

From that point on, the difficulty definitely ramps up. Not sure if it’s just my inexperience or misunderstanding how some abilities work but I actually lost a fighter even on Easy Challenge. Guess that’s the game being fair, not kind.

After playing for a while, you start getting used to it and stop making those critical mistakes that cost you the whole squad.

Feels like it’s all part of the learning curve, frustrating at first, but eventually you get the hang of it.

Visually, the game looks ok, it has a solid pixel-art style, and the character portraits look sharp. The 3D stylization of units on arena also fits the aesthetic well.

As for combat depth, it’s still early to speak for every part of combat system, but so far it feels like most abilities are actually useful. With smart planning and proper use of skills, you can get through harder challenges without taking too much damage.

Demo is worth trying out if you like turn based tactical genre, but if you dont want to play in slow pace - that can be frustrating.",134,7,1750950716.0,,0.86,False,False,Yawaworoht1470,https://i.redd.it/uzpnac63ea9f1.png,new,low

gaming,1lkoz9i,Expedition 33 impressions after beating the game,"I knew I was going to like it because P5 is my fav game and I really enjoy rhythm games. The game is overhyped to the moon, thing happened to me playing Nier Automata, I expected it to be perfect and I hated many things like pacing and how it wasted your time but it still leaves a lot to interpret.

Now for Expedition 33, you can see it's not a perfect game in the first hour by the exploration or gameplay outside fights and cinematics but it doesn't waste your time, the pacing is really fast, maybe too fast jumping from one place to another. 

About the gameplay, I see the limitations in doing repetitive things, getting your skill rotation just right without having to heal, but I also see the insane potential with finding Pictos, leveling up certain skills that are insane, for example:

I come from Persona where you can hyper buff someone (+Atk, passives to deal +75% damage, double damage ability, less defense on enemy, weaknesses, severe magic damage or physical multi-hits)

And now on this game you tell me I can stack up Virtuous Stance 200% dmg, inverse that doubles damage, First strike extra damage, Immolate: not being hit extra damage, +15% from powerful, greater defenseless on enemy, and Maelle 9cost skill multi-hits but damage crits deal double damage, and then Sciel can double that damage too, I was able to deal 250k damage in one hit on my first playthrough damn, I didn't even grind or go out of my way to explore other places, I just spent too much time thinking stuff.

Playing on Extreme the game asks for almost perfection, dying in 1-4 hits you have to learn the timings for parries, I love rhythm games and this is kinda like that.

As for the story its super confusing until the end, but I respect the ballsy move, and they wanted to tell a story of grief and loss and also explain the science fiction in an emotional way, and this is the way. Emotional science fiction is the way, that's what I love about og Sephiroth compared to newer one in remakes, emotionally grounded science fiction.

The music was alright sometimes and others it was absolutely perfect and insane.

It was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. The pacing, locations, enemy types, weapons, music, etc. were really fun, nice looking, and really helped set the tone, although.....ALTHOUGH...XEN to Nihilanth made me want to tear my hair out. Keep in mind, visually OUTSTANDING levels and areas, more cool enemies, but I ran into loads of bugs, and apparently these bugs are known by everyone, and I had to spend so long on those chapters, that it kind of.....I don't want to say ruined the end of the game or last half, but....it certainly made it more repetitive, and more of a chore.

I had played Mario 64 and I was a Nintendo 64 kid so 3D worlds were nothing new to me, but Halo made me rethink everything I knew about 3D. 

And Ocaraina: I actually had a bad first impression of the game, I mean not bad  but after months of hype,  I got it and played the first dungeon and was like ""Really, Nintendo ,  Really"" But the next day I beat the first boss and got out to Hyrule Fields and it was absolutely mind blowing. It was a hub worpd, but there was no currency to get to the next level, it was whatever you had on your person: If you could get there, you could go there. Of course we know now that those old Zelda games were EXTREMElY linear,  so it was really an illusion, but I didn't know that then, and I spent the entire weekend in Hyrule.

gaming,1lke78m,Help me find joy in gaming again? Mid 30-year-old who has lost the spark.,"I don’t know how often this happens to others or is talked about. If the love of video games diminishes over time. 

I remember unboxing my Gameboy and Nintendo in the 1990s. When Halo came out, I sold my PS2 so I could get an Xbox and play Halo. After I’d buy a new video game at the store, I’d read the booklet cover to cover on the way home. 

Through many hardships, like when I got leukemia at 25-years-old, video games were always an escape. Even in the worst moments, getting online would make the day a bit better. 

Some of my best memories include playing League of Legends with all my closest friends, jammed into one dorm room in college. Or trying to unlock armor on Halo Reach. Leveling up my Enhance Shaman during Lich King. And getting Taco Bell with the guys and waiting at GameStop for a midnight release. Building my first PC. Oh, LAN parties. I’d do anything for one more night of Halo 3 with the boys. 

Now, I can’t find a game (other than Balatro) that will hold my attention. I either bore instantly, do not have any joy, or lack any desire to play anything.

I have a wife and kid I love (another coming in August). My job is kinda demanding and I don’t have a ton of free time. 

Maybe this is growing up. I don’t know. 

TL;DR: I can’t tell why I’m losing my desire to play video games. If this is normal for millennials as they get older, or if it’s just something specific to me. 

It’s like a loss of identity in a way. Not that I need to have video games in my life, I just miss the joy they used to bring me. 

Anyone else go through this or find a way to relight the spark?

gaming,1lk3dxk,Don't sleep on DeathStranding 2.,"Just started yesterday and I'm just completely blown away. The game is still largely about delivering items and connecting areas to the Chiral network but the gameplay and story wrapped around it is just so refreshing. 
It also helps that the graphics are some of the best I've seen thanks to the Decimal engine. Same engine used in Horizon Forbidden West. 
Completely blew me away on the OLED display. 

I've also noticed just how masterful Kojima is in crafting the overall experience. Each mission I've played so far felt like a proper handcrafted experience. You get the feeling they play tested the hell out of each mission to ensure they play out not only fun but also keeps players interest/intrigue. First mission I did, had to cut through a bandit camp , ( which this time was more exciting compare to the first game, thanks to the additional combat methods this time around ), only to be completely outnumbered so I had to make a run for it out of there but once I got clear a random sandstorm happens with lighting bolts hitting close to me left and right the whole way through. It was quite the gaming experience and the joy I felt finally getting to my destination was immersurable I'll tell you that. 

In terms of gameplay it's overall quite pleasing to play as well. Performance is solid. I have it running on quality mode on my base PS5 there and I have no complaints. 

Can't wait to dive in some more later after work! 

Early on in the year but already a strong contender for GOTY.

gaming,1ljt0ms,How gaming has evolved over time (discussion),"This has been something I've been thinking about recently and I really want to hear some of your opinions.

So basically, over time, gaming has evolved in many ways, but **the change I want to discuss is the ratio between the increasing quality of games, and the increasing time windows that we now have to wait between games.**

Games have significantly more content than they used to, and the standards of quality have increased exponentially. On the other hand, the release windows for games has also increased many times over what it used to be.

I mean I just remember being a kid and it felt like we would get new big name games like practically every year. 

Now I'm coming to grips with the fact that the next new elder scrolls game I play might be my last (I'm joking but only a little bit). And how does this effect the process? I imagine the team working on the game would probably change over such a long period, does this cause any kind of issues with the original vision for a game being lost?

On the other hand, and this is coming from a retro gamer, metroid just isn't close to as fun and red dead redemption 2. 

And there technically are plenty of games available and being made, but many of these can be from little known indy developers, and while I'd encourage everyone to give a new dev a chance, I also get not wanting to sink money in something that isn't a sure thing in terms of enjoyability. 

There are technically more games than there used to be, but the big AAA games take like 4-8 Years to make these days. 

What are everyone's thoughts on this?

**Does the quality increase of modern games justify the long waiting period between games ?**

I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. 

  


Elden Ring (2022) is my favourite game of all time, and Shadow of the Erdtree (2024) is my favourite DLC of all time. While many emphasize the combat and vast open world, my love for Elden Ring centres on its lore, psychological depth, philosophical underpinnings, and sociological structures. To me, Elden Ring is not merely a game but a platform for examining complex psychological, philosophical, and sociological issues.

**Philosophy: Order, Chaos, and the Search for Meaning**

The story of Elden Ring revolves around the eponymous Elden Ring and its shattering. More than a mere metaphor, the Elden Ring is a physical manifestation of cosmic law and order. Marika's fracturing of the ring represents an act of deconstruction that destabilizes the Lands Between. The conflict among her demigod children showcases how any governing system, no matter how perfect its proponents believe it to be, is influenced by subjective interpretations and conflicts of interest. The shattering of the Elden Ring can thus be seen as a symbol for the ever-increasing tension between the desire for stability and structure and the chaotic, transformative forces beneath the surface. Miquella adds a crucial layer to this dynamic, as the Age of Compassion, where everyone is welcome and not discriminated against \[1\], starkly contrasts the rigid status quo of the Golden Order \[2, 3\] and the destructive Frenzied Flame. In opposition to Miquella's vision, the Frenzied Flame offers a nihilistic outlook: a desire to return to primordial existence through universal immolation to end the suffering, chaos, and despair that inhabit The Lands Between \[4\]. Such an approach of absolute destruction raises questions about this response to profound despair, while Ranni's Age of Stars raises questions about reforming and reimagining fractured and broken worlds \[5\]

Throughout Elden Ring, many different groups have competing ideals that strongly harken back to Nietzsche and the concept of Will to Power (Deleuze, 2006). This is not merely about brute force; it is the fundamental drive to overcome, create, and define values within the world. The Golden Order, the Frenzied Flame, Ranni, and Miquella each represent a unique view on what the proper ""order"" in the world should look like, and each embodies a distinct manifestation of this will. The Golden Order asserts its dominance mainly by physical force, declaring its tenets universal law while suppressing dissenters, their beliefs, and their history (Nietzsche, 2006). The Frenzied Flame, by contrast, seeks to burn everything back into a primordial state.

The Tarnished, an outcast rescued and guided by Grace, explores this broken world. However, this guidance does not diminish player agency; instead, it frames it, as the Tarnished retains complete autonomy over their actions, including which age to usher in. The Lands Between is filled with decay, rotting corpses, unburied horrors, and an oppressive past, all of which force the player to find meaning in what is initially seen as a meaningless world devoid of truth. In this world, old truths have shattered, and purpose is absent. The Tarnished's choice to create or reject a new order echoes the work of Jean-Paul Sartre and his concept of radical freedom (Sartre, 2007). Sartre suggested that humans are fundamentally free, born without a predestined purpose; we can say, think, feel, and do whatever we desire. For him, existence precedes essence; our identity and what we take meaning in are not predetermined or given to us; we make them via our choices.

This lack of a predestined path shows that humans are solely responsible for their choices, not as punishment, but as a recognition that there is no such thing as absolute right or wrong, and no escape from choice; even choosing not to choose is a choice. Because there is no inherent right or wrong, the individual becomes the source of their values, not the external world. Such freedom, of course, carries with it a heavy burden, as each choice carries an intense weight. Sartre (2007) identified three emotional consequences of this absolute freedom: anguish, where anxiety arises from having such freedom and responsibility; forlornness, the isolation that comes with these choices, as we are the meaning-makers; and despair, the fact that the only actions we can rely on are our own, as we lack control over external events and the actions of others. As a largely blank slate for the player, the Tarnished perfectly embodies this existential journey, as the player's choices define their essence.

The Tarnished can themselves be viewed through a philosophical lens. Through insurmountable odds, seemingly endless challenges, and making choices in a meaningless world, the Tarnished can represent the absurd hero (Camus, 1991), who finds dignity and purpose in rebellion against meaninglessness. The Tarnished's existence and their choices as they persevere against all odds are an act of defiance against the notion of meaninglessness.

The game also explores the ethics of power and choice. Each ending the player can choose is not merely an option for a trophy; it represents an ethical stance on what should happen to the Lands Between and can encourage the player to consider their choice. The Age of Fracture mends the Elden Ring, and the Golden Order remains steadfast, as does the status quo. In contrast, the Frenzied Flame offers absolute destruction. However, its moral standing is ambiguous: is it truly nihilistic, or is it an act of mercy intended to end a cycle of profound suffering? These questions and the possible endings challenge players to confront their moral compass.

Queen Marika's removal of the Rune of Death \[6\] raises specific questions. If existence is constant and devoid of death, what worth can be ascribed to life, experience, and suffering? The constant respawning of weaker foes underscores the notion that immortality, when devoid of purpose and evolution, can be a curse rather than a blessing, leading to stagnation, decay, and a loss of meaning in existence itself.

Finally, the Outer Gods introduce the nature of divinity. Powers such as the God of Rot and the Formless Mother often influence and manipulate those in the Lands Between \[7\], rendering them pawns in a game they do not understand, with rules and stakes they cannot even begin to recognize. The Outer Gods bring about questions of free will, determinism, and the agency one has when faced with divine wills. Elden Ring is about cycles, reprisals, decay, and potential rebirth. The Golden Order perpetuates a cycle of dominance that resists change. In contrast, Ranni's Age of Stars signifies a profound yearning for rupture, change, and an end to this stagnant cycle, a breaking from the cycle of suffering. The Tarnished's choice is personal and represents whether the world will be trapped in an endless cycle or reborn.

**Psychology: Scars of Trauma and the Grip of Obsession**

The Lands Between is a traumatized space; The Shattering represents not merely an event in time, but an active, open wound: an ongoing trauma that refuses to heal, deeply scarring the land (van der Kolk, 2014). Players can see the warfare and sense immense decay as the land continually relives its trauma, evoking the psychological aftermath over the Lands. Likewise, the Land of Shadow can be seen as a repressed collective trauma due to Marika casting a veil over it, effectively causing it to be forgotten, mirroring how societies can repress painful memories to cope with overwhelming events.

Elden Ring features numerous groups bound by obsessive fanaticism and a unique response to a broken world. Nowhere is this more apparent than within The Golden Order, with their cognitive rigidity and confirmation bias, where belief systems become exclusionary and resistant to differing views on truth. Furthermore, many within the Order engage in cognitive dissonance (Festinger, 1957), staunchly adhering to the Order's decaying tenets and refusing to question how such a perfect order could have made the world so broken.

Lineage, parental actions, expectations, and the confronting failures of previous generations also shape the lives of many characters. Miquella, for instance, strives to create an Age of Compassion, seeking to transcend the Golden Order's limitations and build a perfect system for those rejected by the Erdtree and to atone for the harm of his mother \[8\]. Ranni, who was supposed to be the next Carian Queen, renounces her role as future queen \[9\] in favour of the Age of Stars, actively defining her destiny apart from her inherited expectations.

Elden Ring also employs Jungian archetypes extensively (Jung, 1968a; 1968b). Marika, for example, embodies the great mother and the shadow as she shattered the Elden Ring. Radagon, in contrast, may serve as a fragmented aspect of the self. The Erdtree can represent a World Tree, a symbol of totality and connection. Understanding such symbols can enhance the depth of understanding of Elden Ring and showcase universal collective unconscious patterns within the game (Bean, 2023). Elden Ring also showcases how hubris and ambition can lead to ruin. Marika's children are driven to claim the Elden Ring for themselves. However, this leads to a ceaseless war characterized by madness and horrible transformations (physical, mental, and emotional), with Radahn being perhaps the most well-known casualty as the scarlet rot afflicted him and drove him to madness \[10\]. Morgott is a tragic victim, fanatically devoted to an Order that rejected him \[11\].

**Sociology: Power Dynamics, Hierarchy, Control, and Feminism**

Elden Ring presents a complex interplay of power dynamics, religious hegemony, and social stratification with a distinct social hierarchy. Marika and her children are at the apex, while beings such as the Omens are at the bottom. Structurally, this hierarchy is also evident. Compare the beautiful capital city of Leyndell with the numerous dilapidated villages scattered throughout, along with the wretched underground beneath the capital; the game emphasizes heavy social exclusion based on unchosen characteristics. For example, Omens, when born, either have their horns removed as infants, a process that many do not survive \[12\] or are confined deep underground \[13\]. The Omens undergo a form of eugenics based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority. Ostracization and persecution are perhaps nowhere better exemplified than in Those Who Live in Death; the Golden Order considers their entire existence an affront to the Order's ideology of life, death, and rebirth \[14\], showing that those who defy prevailing ideological norms will be subject to active persecution and social ostracism.

The Golden Order is not merely a religious doctrine to be passively followed; it is also a force that has asserted its dominance all across the land through conquest and assimilation. The Order and its beliefs are rigid and unwilling to tolerate differing faiths and cultures to preserve and control what they view as accurate. Examples of these conquests and assimilations include the Fire Giants, whom the Order viewed as a threat \[15\] and, as a final act of humiliation, forced one last Fire Giant to guard the flame that could burn the Erdtree \[16\]. In a more subtle form of cultural assimilation, the Golden Order had Radagon wed Rennala, ending the Liurnian War through marriage rather than destruction \[17, 18\].

The theories of Michel Foucault (1990, 1995) can also be applied to Elden Ring's concept of power, specifically how it intertwines with knowledge and discourse. The Golden Order does not simply maintain control via military might; it controls what is considered truth and history, normalizing certain behaviours while forbidding and punishing others. Again, turning to the Omens, who were harmed and segregated based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority, reflects Foucault's ideas on how power structures create and enforce norms via exclusion and discipline, and how those in power use more than force to bend and shape minds and bodies by shaping the very reality of what is acceptable and what is not.

Elden Ring also has a strong focus on determinism vs. free will. Framing events as predetermined and predestined might seem to dissuade action. However, the player's choices to defy or fulfil these prophecies comment on an individual's ability to break from (or continue) societal expectations (Bogost, 2007; Rendle & Pasternack, 2025). The game's narrative often presents prophecies, yet the agency given to the Tarnished allows for the subversion or affirmation of these preordained paths, making the player's interaction with destiny a key theme.

Beyond the Omens (discussed extensively), the game shows other systematic subjugation with the Albinaurics, who were created by human hands \[19\] and persecuted by the Knights of the Cuckoos for their defiled blood \[20\]. Albinaurics mirror historical patterns of social subjection based on perceived genetic and physical inferiority and are used only for their utility (Du Bois, 1994; Marx & Engels, 2002). Even the last Fire Giant's forced humiliation is an act of prolonged psychological and social subjugation from the Golden Order.

Finally, the Shattering left the Lands Between in a stagnant, violent cycle with seemingly no end. Even after the death of certain demigods, many of their forces remain, and the repercussions, abetted by the unburied dead and decaying lands, are omnipresent. Such a portrayal represents a view of the sociological aftermath of systemic conflict. Even after authorities collapse, societies can become trapped in cycles of conflict and decay, and the Tarnished can often find themselves as mere pawns, mirroring the fact that so many people can become engaged in conflict with profound and ambiguous consequences.

**Feminism in Elden Ring**

Like many other FromSoft games, Elden Ring is rich in feminist interpretations, featuring many excellent and strong female characters (or female-presenting characters) who wield tremendous power and significance. Queen Marika herself is the central figure in Elden Ring. While strong, she also possesses a degree of suffering and entrapment \[21\]. Ranni the Witch actively rejects her role and seeks to establish a new order free from the influence of the Outer Gods. Her desire for autonomy and self-determination is central to much feminist literature. Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is an incredible warrior whose prowess with a blade is unmatched \[22\], even with her scarlet rot; this serves as a testament to her resilience and determination. Melina is another central character who serves as a guide for the player. Initially seeking to make it to the Erdtree to understand the purpose given to her by her mother \[23\], Melina eventually gains agency and volition in forging her own path, refusing the purpose her mother gave her \[24, 25\].

Even Miquella, another Empyrean, is presented with a feminine appearance and manner. His perpetually young \[26\] and feminine form starkly contrasts with the rugged, imposing physiques of the other male demigods, such as Godfrey, Godrick, and especially Radahn. His youthful, feminine appearance is complemented by his gentle demeanour and goal of creating an age based on compassion and inclusion rather than using brute force. Miquella's quest contrasts traditional, often aggressive displays of power by men, showcasing that influence in the Lands Between is not simply tied to conventional masculinity and acts of violence and war. Elden Ring features matrilineal societies: women hold significant power as Gods, queens, leaders, and Empyreans, and leaders (e.g., Queen Marika, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, Lunar Princess Ranni, Gloam-Eyed Queen, Malenia, Blade of Miquella, Hornsent Grandam). One striking observation is that all the candidates for Godhood were either female (Ranni, Malenia, Marika, Gloam-Eyed Queen) or appeared as feminine in appearance and mannerisms (Miquella, who is a stark contrast to every other male demigod). To me, this suggests a fundamental connection between femininity and divine power. The stories of Marika, Ranni, Melina, and Miquella touch upon themes of autonomy and the fight against the predetermined. For example, Ranni sheds her body to escape her fate, and Melina, having finally found her purpose, lights herself aflame in an act of agency.

Elden Ring may not be overtly ""in your face"" with feminism like other games, but there is plenty here for rich feminist interpretations. The game showcases a world with powerful women and feminine characters central to the story, whose struggles revolve around agency, fighting against external control, and challenging destiny.

Elden Ring is a work of art in every sense of the word. It is a rich and fertile ground for academics to explore complex themes of philosophy (such as discussing order, chaos, meaning, radical freedom and the will to stop various warring factions while creating meaning from the meaningless), psychology (how the world of Elden Ring is an open-world deeply scarred by past and ongoing trauma as the many inhabitants contend with obsession, cognitive dissonance, and generational burdens all while embodying various archetypes that resonate with the collective unconscious of the world), and sociology (as it presents a world filled with power dynamics, social stratification, and the torment of marginalized groups, offering an example of Foucauldian power structures and the persistent cycles of conflict and control). Finally, the game stands out for its strong feminist undertones as it presents strong female and feminine-presenting characters who actively (rather than passively) defy traditional tropes and champion themes of agency, autonomy, and self-determination. As I said at the start, Elden Ring is my favourite game of all time, and the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC is my favourite DLC of all time; each is a work of art that asks the player to deeply explore a narrative that challenges preconceived notions and beliefs while providing insight into the human condition and ethical thought.

gaming,1ljbfpy,Finding Beauty in Terror: Eroguro in Silent Hill f.,"Silent Hill f is the game I am most excited for this year; I even bought the deluxe edition for $27 because I saved up PS Stars points for nearly two years just for this game. Since the initial trailer, I have been fixated on the concept of eroguro and its connection to the game. Having been in post-secondary for the last eight years, I wrote a small academic paper on the connection between eroguro and Silent Hill f.  I hope you love reading it as much as I loved writing it.

**Blossoming Horror: The** ***Eroguro*** **Influence in** ***Silent Hill f***

The serene Japanese village of Ebisugaoka in *Silent Hill f* undergoes a disturbing transformation into blossoming horror, marking a profound and fascinating departure for the acclaimed franchise. Unveiled in 2022, *Silent Hill f* quickly garnered significant attention from fans due to its notable shift from the traditional American Midwest setting to 1960s rural Japan. The game’s debut trailer presented a striking blend of rustic aesthetics intertwined with profound horrors, indicating a marked departure from an industrial American ideal. Instead, the game favours a framework heavily rooted in *eroguro*. The presence of parasitic flora and fauna, the disintegration of a young schoolgirl's innocence, and the unsettling juxtaposition of beauty with decay are pivotal. The game employs an *eroguro* framework to forge a psychologically distinct horror experience, aiming to instill fear in players by delving into the beauty within the grotesque.

**A Shift in Aesthetic and Narrative**

The *Silent Hill* franchise is characteristically defined by elements like rust, fog, industrial decay, and monsters influenced by Freudian concepts. These elements are evident from the dilapidated titular town in *Silent Hill* to the confined apartment of *Silent Hill 4: The Room*. However, *Silent Hill f* represents a notable departure in its narrative and aesthetic framework. It transitions from an industrial context to a rural Japanese village, introducing monsters embodying a paradoxical blend of beauty and horror. This shift transcends mere visual changes; it signals a significant evolution in artistic direction. This evolution is deeply rooted in the influences of *eroguro*. Silverberg (2007) states that *eroguro* constitutes a distinct genre within Japanese art. To fully understand its applicability to the game, we must deconstruct its three core components: the erotic, the grotesque, and the nonsensical. Individually, these themes define *eroguro's* unique characteristics. When combined, however, their true and unsettling nature takes shape.

**The Three Pillars of** ***Eroguro***

(1) Ero (Erotic)

Erotic transcends mere explicit sexuality; it encapsulates notions of sensuality, allure, beauty, and elements perceived as desirable. The trailers showcase a lush, beautiful, quiet life, initially displaying traditional Japanese architecture among hills, rice fields, and village streets. Such imagery often features young schoolgirls, who embody purity and tranquillity.

However, by the end of the trailer, this lush beauty becomes nightmarish. Plants bloom from humans, entangle bodies, and consume buildings. This transformation from something beautiful into something horrific mirrors the perversion of the desirable. What was once captivating becomes deeply unsettling, and the serene, picturesque village becomes ominous and distorted.

(2) Guro (Grotesque)

The grotesque does not solely denote gore and violence. Instead, it signifies deformations, disturbances, and unsettling perversions of form and function. It evokes a sense of inherent wrongness or corruption that starkly contrasts with what one might typically consider beautiful, ordinary, or innocent. We easily see this element in the monsters, especially the flower girl from the first trailer.

(3) Nonsense

Nonsense pertains to surrealism, absurdity, and illogical constructs often accompanying the genre's disturbing essence. This element encompasses dreamlike states, abrupt transformations, and narratives that resist rational interpretation, engendering cognitive dissonance and discomfort. We can see this element in the village; the fog and flowers consuming Ebisugaoka transform the small, quiet town into a surreal and illogical nightmare.

**Provocative Themes and Historical Context**

The confluence of these three elements interrogates various provocative themes. These include beauty, decay, attraction, repulsion, depravity, perversion, and the darker, often taboo dimensions of human desire. The resultant discomfort may emanate not solely from visual and thematic representations of bodies, but also from the disquietude of societal norms and psychological states.

This art style reached its zenith during the Taishō (1912-1926) and early Shōwa eras (1927-1945). Westernization, banning erotic art, warfare, industrialization, urban anxieties, such as class divide, social dislocation, economic instability, cultural clashes, and the subsequent American occupation characterized these periods (Gordon, 2019). These multifaceted factors contributed to the emergence of artistic expressions that, despite restrictive circumstances, subverted traditional norms. While eroguro had its apex in the Taishō and early Shōwa era, it was suppressed during World War II, only to reemerge after the war and influence entertainment like music and manga (McLelland, 2006).

**Deconstructing Horror Through** ***Eroguro***

By employing an analytical lens focused on aesthetic and cultural transformations in this game through the prism of *eroguro*, we can adeptly deconstruct its distinctive approach to horror. This approach is intricately woven into the complex fabric of Japanese cultural narratives, belief systems, historical contexts, and aesthetic principles.

A fundamental principle within the *eroguro* genre is the juxtaposition of beauty and the grotesque. The horror manifests not merely through the monstrosities encountered by the player but rather in the degradation of what is conventionally perceived as beautiful. The trailers for this game effectively illustrate this principle. They present an idyllic village characterized by a picturesque landscape, traditional Japanese architecture, and a young schoolgirl.

However, this perception of beauty is systematically subverted as a red spider lily (*Lycoris radiata*) begins to overrun the village. These flowers, known as higanbana, are frequently found near graveyards and are deeply associated with themes of death and the afterlife in Buddhist contexts. The game employs these flowers as agents, initiating a transition from aesthetic beauty to the grotesque. A youthful girl blooming with these beautiful flowers appears in the inaugural trailer; she embodies a duality, being both a monster and an object of beauty.

**Symbolism and Psychological Depth**

In Japan, young girls serve as a compelling symbol within cultural discourse. They exist in various states that straddle the lines of innocence (a stark contrast to the horror engulfing the village) and burgeoning sexuality. This duality positions them as significant vessels for exploring themes such as corruption, guilt, shame, fear, and repression. The 1960s in Japan were marked by profound upheaval (Gordon, 2019), during which traditional values encountered the challenges posed by modern and increasingly liberal ideologies. Consequently, young women faced intense societal pressure to adhere to ascribed roles.

Under the framework of *eroguro*, the horrors depicted can therefore be argued to be not merely external manifestations, but an internal horror projected outward. The game's writer, Ryukishi07, powerfully demonstrates this tradition of using innocent-presenting characters to explore deep psychological turmoil. In his celebrated Higurashi: When They Cry series, he masterfully juxtaposes extreme trauma and brutal violence in a serene village setting with moé, an aesthetic built on attraction and affection for cute fictional characters (Galbraith, 2014), which can include a desire to protect them (Galbraith, 2009).

Ryukishi07’s involvement strongly suggests that the imagery of flowers in the game could symbolize trauma, guilt, repressed memories, forbidden desires, or the overwhelming social pressure to conform, ultimately blossoming into a grotesque beauty. Such themes resonate with a fundamental aspect of *Silent Hill*: the psychological terrain made manifest, yet now interpreted through a distinctly Japanese cultural and aesthetic lens articulated by *eroguro*.

**A New Frontier for Horror**

By integrating the concept of *eroguro*, *Silent Hill f* is positioned to offer an exceptionally unsettling horror experience. This experience creates unease and repulsion, inducing a perverse interpretation of beauty and transgressing various social taboos. The dynamic interplay between beauty and horror will likely make a distressing narrative as the environments and monsters fuse these elements. This fusion will create a strong sense of discomfort and psychological unease. Critically, the *eroguro* framework allows the title to present the multifaceted concept of *eroguro* to a broader audience, showcasing that perhaps the most profound terror may be hidden in what we consider beautiful, allowing for a critical reassessment of what horror and beauty truly mean.

So I gave ""A Plague Tale: Innocence"" a shot, and wow... I didn’t expect to enjoy it this much.

It’s a pretty intense game though; sad, grim, and grounded in a way that really sticks with you. The things you do as Amicia are heavy, and the game doesn't shy away from showing how she and the people around her change because of it. Hugo is a kid, and yes, sometimes I struggle with bratty-ish characters, but his kindness was actually a nice counter to the bleak setting. Their dynamic felt real.

Gameplay-wise, it’s slow-paced but never boring. The stealth and puzzles kept things moving, and the atmosphere was spot on. The story pulled me in right away. I played the PS5 version and it looks great (cutscene character animations stutter a bit here and there, but nothing too bad).

If you like short, focused games with solid gameplay and an immersive story, I’d absolutely recommend it!! Can’t wait to dive into *Requiem (*and there’s a third one on the way too!!!)

gaming,1liy4c5,"What are the best and worst ""interlude"" levels in gaming?","Let me explain. These are missions or levels you can't skip and use game mechanics that will never be used again across the entire game. They are usually located between acts of the story and usually involve one character doing his own thing apart from the rest. 

I have to go back pretty far to think of both of my examples since they have thankfully been phased out of modern gaming to a large extent. 

The first is the Titan suit in Jack and Daxter franchise. I don't know why this exists. You walk around in an armored suit you never see again that plays completely differently from the regular game. Jak 2 and 3 both have this but only once per game. 

The second is a double whammy in final fantasy 12. In that game you have two levels after the first act and before the final act where the MC walks around a big city talking to random people to solve a puzzle to advance the story. Aside from the basic premise the mechanics are completely different and they are both tedious.

Game Pass is undeniably great value right now. But, if you look to Netflix, Amazon Prime, Uber, etc. you'll see what's in store for this service, long-term.

The game plan for any ""disruptive"" service-based product is as follows:

1. Offer a killer value proposition at great prices
2. Get people hooked and build up a critical mass of users
3. Kill off all the competition (or force the competition to copy you)

gaming,1liukek,First Time Playing Tales of Symphonia — Does It Still Hold Up? 🤔🤨,"*Note: My last post got taken down due to including an image, so I'm re-uploading it as a Text Post.*

Hey everyone, I'm going to start playing **Tales of Symphonia** on the GameCube for the first time for my *retro gaming podcast*, and I’m curious how others feel about it today.

I know it was a big deal when it first came out in 2003—especially for GameCube JRPG fans—but I’m wondering how well it holds up for new players in 2025?

Would love to hear your thoughts on:

* The characters and themes
* The combat mechanics and difficulty
* Whether the HD ports are the best way to experience it
* If you’ve played it recently (or back in the day), do you think it still holds its own compared to other retro RPGs?

Appreciate any insight, nostalgia, or tips from those who know this one well!

Would love to hear your thoughts, memories, or advice as I go through it for the first time!

Side Note: Since I'm planning to cover it in an upcoming podcast, I'm also open to guest speakers for the Tales of Symphonia episode.

I did respec a few times while playing elden ring, only because I didn't want to grind to be able to use the gear I wanted, I also had about 150 hours on one save file, so starting a new game sounded like a chore especially when I still had more content to do.

>Hideo Kojima once again proves to be a singular creative force in the video game industry, crafting a sequel in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach that is not just essential for fans of the first game, but an essential experience for all gamers.

>Death Stranding 2 isn’t the revolution that the first game was. Instead, it refines almost all aspects of the original to make an excellent, well-polished experience. On the Beach firmly establishes the Death Stranding universe and makes it a franchise in which I could see many more stories told (even if they’re not by Kojima himself). It might be Kojima’s most well-rounded title to date, and it shows that he’s still got the touch even as he enters his 60s. However, I give the game a 10 with the same caveats I mentioned in the intro. I love Kojima’s work and was already invested in the world of Death Stranding. If you bounced off the original game, Death Stranding 2 isn’t likely to reel you in. However, fans will find it a worthy sequel that’ll leave them begging for more.

>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an epic, big budget sequel to Kojima's controversial cult classic. It offers a better story, an excellent cast of characters, and beautiful world to reconnect. Death Stranding 2 feels like the product of everything that's happened to Kojima since he left Konami, and it's easily one of 2025's very best.Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an all-time great sequel and one of Hideo Kojima's best games.

>Death Stranding 2 is phenomenal. It’s among Kojima’s very best work not just for its narrative, but for the near-limitless variety in its gameplay opportunities. While it may very well end up being the final game in the series, at least with Kojima at the helm, we can only hope someone else picks up the mantle and continues to iterate on one of gaming’s most unique experiences. After all, why else would we have connected?

>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is a triumph in what it sets out to achieve. This isn't a game interested in converting willing consumers into fans, it's a game that takes bold steps in order to succeed what came before it. If you needed proof that Hideo Kojima is still the titan of the industry that he's hailed as, this game is that proof.

>Technically flawless and visually stunning, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an exceptional sequel and a clear evolution for a game that was already full of qualities. An even more engaging story with an improved narrative, as well as huge advances in its unique gameplay, are just some of the highlights of one of the best games of the year.

>The original Death Stranding held promise: A complex, often confusing, but never contrived first draft. A reflective journey across a lost America, it established a world and its rules with a flourish, even if I found it stumbled along the path. But in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Australia plays host to an expanded vision and is a more accomplished achievement in nearly every facet. It removes almost all of the friction that weighed down its rookie effort, delighting with a truly unpredictable story full of intrigue and malleable stealth-action playgrounds hidden in its vast, hauntingly beautiful version of Australia. Yes, at times, it is unapologetically weird – but that isn't what defines it. It's an inventive journey packed full of both shock and awe, the sort of bold work that deserves to be encouraged. No, it isn't perfect, but it's incredibly exciting and original, never once straying from the path less trodden, and I love it all the more for it.

>*Death Stranding 2: On The Beach* consumed me. Not simply because I can easily get absorbed in slow, methodical gameplay, but because it is so well-developed as a game that it *makes* getting sucked into it incredibly effortless. It genuinely feels like the current best version of whatever these “Strand-type” games are meant to be, and if Kojima has hit his stride this early, I can’t wait to see what else is in store. If you weren’t the biggest fan of the first game, I almost guarantee *Death Stranding 2: On The Beach* will turn you into one.

[Inverse - Trone Dowd](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-playstation-5) \- 9 / 10

>*Death Stranding 2* is another anomaly in the modern gaming landscape. It’s got a weird premise, a weird visual identity, and even weirder ideas for what a $70 game should be. And while this sequel largely iterates on the first game’s ideas to create something broader, it thankfully stays true to what made the original distinct. Sure, I wish *Death Stranding 2* showed more than it tells. Kojima could benefit from emulating how concisely many of his director friends in Hollywood deliver their own stories. Or how to write natural dialogue more consistently. But the overall vision of *Death Stranding 2* is so bold and uncompromising that it brute-forces its way through these shortcomings. *Death Stranding 2: On The Beach* may not be for everyone. But if it is for you, it's one of the most enjoyable games of 2025, a must-see follow-up that is more cohesive, refined, and fully developed than the first.

>Kojima’s ability to upend established AAA convention is admirable and despite the self-indulgence and the man’s swelling vanity (and appetite for space travel), Death Stranding 2 is a bold reminder of this. It’s a goofy spectacle, the folly of a man who has let it all go a bit to his head, utterly bizarre and enigmatically incoherent but nevertheless an earnest exploration of loss and connection. At any other studio, such a muzzily, decadent vision would have led to a quiet aside to tone it down or been simply shelved in favour of a safer bet. Thankfully, Kojima’s auteur status means he’s immune to this, free to fling about millions as he sees fit. Long may it continue.

>*Death Stranding* is one of my favourite games of all time, and I’m equally as obsessed with its sequel. It’s not only one of the best-looking games I’ve ever seen with an endearing cast of characters and soundtrack, but once you look past much of its filler, its story is a message of beauty. Humanity cuts itself off from the world, too fearful to make a connection, but when they take a risk to let others in, there’s an unexpected comforting warmth. Something that, in one way or another, is a notion we can all resonate with. *Death Stranding 2: On the Beach* deserves to be in the Game of the Year conversation. It’s hands down one of my favourite games in recent years, and I can’t wait to see what Sam and friends deliver next.

>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is a hard game to quantify, with Kojima Productions eager to question our expectations and hurl curveballs at every turn. At its heart, it’s an experience about delivering packages and forging connections across a post-apocalyptic world, but play it for just a few hours, and you’ll see it’s so much more than that. It’s a game defined by filling a nature reserve with teleporting emus as much as it is about a lonely man learning to accept help from the people who love him and avoid being consumed by grief whose sole purpose is to destroy him. It’s about human connection, losing loved ones, and stepping out into the wild regardless of the horrors that may await. Learning to go on that journey and accept a willingness to grow is half the battle, and after reaching the end of this ordeal, you’ll never be the same again. Keep on keeping on.

>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an improvement over Death Stranding in almost every way I can think of. It's larger, full of more things to do, and generally a more enjoyable experience. The plot is crazier than ever, which might be a plus or minus depending on your tastes, but if nothing else, it isn't boring. The only complaint I can think of is that the game is perhaps a touch too easy at times, and even that isn't a huge problem. If you liked the first game, it's very easy to imagine you liking the sequel. Just be prepared for things to be as unfathomably ridiculous as possible at every turn.

>My 35+ hours with Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was laced with so many emotions and feelings: boredom, excitement, joy, confusion, and satisfaction. \[Death Stranding 2\] still has the trademarks of a Kojima-written narrative -""Muffin Man""-style dialogue, bats\*\*\* insane moments, subtle-as-a-sledgehammer storytelling with obvious symbolism. But that's what makes this sequel all the more endearing; you may cringe at some moments, but you won't be bored with the thread being spun here.

>For those who rolled their eyes at much of the first game, Death Stranding 2 will likely inspire a similar reaction. But there is no doubt that Kojima remains wide-eyed. This big, absurd game is, in many ways, the ultimate synthesis of the writer-director's idiosyncrasies and obsessions while containing, amid the noise, perhaps his clearest message yet. The world may be a mess but its problems cannot be solved alone by communicating over the internet - indeed, retreating into it. Go, step outside. Don't just touch grass; embrace another person.

>The greater emphasis on action and worldbuilding might move Death Stranding 2 away from the hiking focus I loved about the original but, as a Metal Gear Solid fan, this is a thrilling mix that helps this sequel stand apart rather than just reheating the same thing. Ultimately, I really love how worldbuilding has been expanded here, making Sam's adventure feel a lot more lively thanks to the Drawbridge crew. That's what I'll carry forward from this one – while wishing I had a real life Dollman to join me on my weekly shop. Hideo Kojima compared his approach to the sequel as going from Alien to Aliens – the same story in a different genre. I can feel that when I play it. But it does have me wondering – as the credits roll after a series of lengthy ending cutscenes that are so bizarre you wouldn't believe me even if I *did* spoil them – what will the Alien 3 of Death Stranding look like?

>Ultimately, playing through Death Stranding 2 was an emotional and utterly enjoyable experience, full of thrills and impossible to put down during its bigger moments. My only negative feeling towards it is also unfortunately a big one, that I wish Kojima Productions went further in evolving this sequel from the original. When the story goes to such an extent to explore new grounds, it's kind of a shame the gameplay feels the need to play it safe.

>Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end. The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can't help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.

>The first Death Stranding was eerily prescient. Releasing in 2019, it was impossible to divorce it from the COVID-19 pandemic that followed a year later, the parallels between preppers living in bunkers and people struggling to find ways to connect with others reflecting a period of quarantine and uncertainty about the future. By contrast, Death Stranding 2 is less precise and clear about what it wants to say; it seems committed to making you ponder many things at once, inviting different takeaways. Its story touches on topics like the increasing harms of climate change, how our everyday actions are being automated with each passing day, the damaging presence of guns, the clash between governments and privately owned entities, and the importance of helping others in any way we can. If the sequel is prescient of anything, it is that fixation on the past binds us to repeat history, no matter how much we try to pretend otherwise.",865,497,1750679951.0,,0.87,True,False,ChiefLeef22,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1liepg4/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach_review_thread/,new,medium

Don't get me wrong here. 

They do what they do, and people like that, I would never claim that is wrong to enjoy a game you do enjoy.

But then I see people claiming that GTA6 will be ""the game of the century"" or ""Sweep the TGA's next year"" and so on... and while i understand people being fans of it, I just for the life of me can't really understand that mindset?

I myself have noticed games going up even in the past few months i.e around the end of last year I remember seeing quite a few games I wanted for around £15 shipped and they were around £18-£21 shipped CIB.

The same games now are more like £25 - £31 CIB, and even the more common games that would of been around £13 shipped CIB are reaching around £20 sometimes even more never below £13.

Anyway I found the receipt from the games I bought a few years ago, one was £6 boxed but no manual, the same game now on Ebay is £13 shipped with no manual, the company I bought from is around £10/£11 boxed.

Another game I paid £8 for is £12 at the stores, and about the same price shipped on Ebay.

Another game I paid £10 for cart only is £19 at that store and around £20 shipped online.

(and of course the store would only offer around £7 for that game they sell for £19, no joke just checked)

Anything inviting a discussion is also welcome, of course I'd just be a reader to that but still. When did you play the game series for the first time, any special memory associated with them, your own top 3 Zelda games, just about anything goes. 

Tell me something I don't know (basically everything since I know basically nothing of the series)!

P.S. Image taken from google, hope that is allowed here. Wouldn't let me post multiple images in a post.",0,22,1750607376.0,,0.33,False,False,Dr_Doofenschmirtzz,https://i.redd.it/gkr7wavh2i8f1.jpeg,new,low

I also met a group of people and we started to play together more often. I would end up trying out more different types of games that I didn't even know about.

This topic is inspired by my recent purchase of Elden Ring Nightreign. Within a few minutes of my first run, I knew that I was gonna have a bad time. It's basically anathema to the things I enjoy in video games; exploring, drinking in the atmosphere, looking for secrets, etc. There's no time for any of that. The night is coming. Kill shit, get loot that you barely have time to read what it does, run, run, run, kill more shit, get more loot, fight boss, repeat. I just found the whole experience to be anxiety-inducing in a way that made it impossible for me to enjoy, which is a shame. I really like the idea of the Nightfarers all having different unique powers, and a Souls roguelite seems like it would be right up my alley. It's just the time limit that absolutely kills the experience for me.

gaming,1lhm0yp,"Am I misunderstanding what ""open world"" means?","I've mostly had a Switch for the past few years but recently upgraded my computer and was looking for a fun game to play on it. One of my favourite games is Breath of the Wild. One of the top recommendations for open world games was Red Dead Redemption 2 so I decided to pick get it.

I've been playing Red Dead Redemption for a bit, and I'm enjoying the game, but it's not really what I expected. It seems like the game guides you on certain quests and you don't really have the ability to just wander.  It seems more similar to something like the Tomb Raider series where there's a specific story line you are supposed to be following.

I'm not too far into the game yet, I'm in the camp outside Valentine and I've done a couple quests in there.  But it seems like when I complete a quest I just get thrown back into another mandatory quest whenever I talk to any of my camp mates. Otherwise it doesn't really give any direction about what I'm supposed to be doing. 

Maybe I'm approaching the game wrong and I should avoid talking to other people and spend some more time wandering and just maybe go hunting and getting some supplies. 

One other issue is that there's some things that make exploring less enticing. I accidentally bumped into people in town and it started a fight, and then I end up with some wanted poster on my head which means I'm basically not allowed in town anymore. So I had to revert to a previous save or else miss out on that town completely.  I like the idea of being able to make decisions  that have consequences, but I also don't want the game to get into some kind of unplayable state where I can't do important story lines.

Sorry if this is a long post.

I'm talking about the time when you've lowered your guard and think you know everything about what's going on. Can casually farm or walk through stuff without concern.  Now, a friend said for him it was Ark in general, for me it's kind of a two-answer from the same game.

So my very first Soulslike or Soulsborn game was Bloodborne, you want to talk about someone sucking eggs at something. But perseverance and pattern recognition paid off, until I crossed a certain bridge. While this boss wasn't hard, I'd already spent all my flasks and was under half hp. But I trudged across this bridge, unaware of the Cleric monster waiting. I'd not been able to pinpoint bossrooms yet. This concept was entirely new for me, so the cutscene and ass kicking that followed shocked me.

Now here is where it happened twice and I lowered my guard, see I thought that was its best shot. I figured the worst this game could throw at me was Cleric Beast. Let's talk about Father Gascoigne. I spent days trying to beat this man, not understanding why my ideas of just out level him weren't working. Just trying everything to figure out his patterns. When I saw him I was cocky thought after Bloodstarved beast, I knew what this game had to offer. It took somewhere like 300 attempts before I beat him finally.

>As it turns out, fans weren't the only ones to draw those comparisons – **so did Marinelli himself.** Kojima says that when he asked the actor how he and his friends reacted to his [Death Stranding 2](https://www.gamesradar.com/death-stranding-2-guide/) character reveal, **Marinelli said: ""'Oh Snake is wonderful. I'm so happy to be Snake'**

>""I needed someone who can top Mads \[Mikkelsen\] and Cliff,"" he said. ""I thought Luca could do it."" That intuition was proven correct once Marinelli arrived on set – ""His acting was just so, so spectacular,"" Kojima went on.

movies,1lve4eg,"""Dances with Wolves"" (1990) - A epic, grand Western which revived the genre and made Kevin Costner into the ultimate actor-director of his generation","I was won over by the opening act, when Kevin Costner's Lt. John Dunbar goes suicidal as he rides his horse with open arms and the music of John Barry swoons. 

Everything else afterwards paled by comparison. As the story continues, with John Dunbar travelling into the American Frontier, coming in contact with the Lakota and changing his life as a result does end up going into the trope of the White Savior. Dunbar becomes ""Dances with Wolves"", falls for a white woman who got kidnapped as a child and became part of the tribe (a winning Mary McDonnell) and becomes a integral part of the group, helping the Lakota in catching the Buffalos, going into war with the American soldiers, learning about the struggle of the Native Americans within the environment.

A far cry from the racist Westerns made popular for decades within the Industry. The film is more understanding in offering a perspective of the Native American yet still places a Caucasian male at the center of the story. 

Either way, it's beautifully films and for the time, more progressive. Kevin Costner is good as Dunbar, Mary McDonnell is wonderful in a role I wish had been more explored and strong supporting turns from Graham Greene and Tantoo Cardinal. 

Dean Semler's cinematography is majestic and wide, a film which even when the dialogue or acting isn't always appealing, the imagery is prepossessing enough to distract you from any of its flaws.

Yesterday was the second day with Bahrain. Today is Bangladesh. 

Our second day winner, from Bahrain, is **Hamad and the Pirates (1971) directed by Richard Lyford.** I know nothing about this movie other than it apparently is a Disney movie, yet sadly not on Disney Plus. It is not on 1337x. If anyone has access on how to view it, feel free to comment. 

Okay let's do **Bangladesh.**

It's a little country east of India that oftentimes lingers in India's shadow. So let's let this beautiful country stand on its own today in film!

The rules:

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

movies,1lva1ze,The Substance (abuse of Stabilizer),"I mean, I get why they made the plot the way they did, but... I also kinda wonder if, instead of Elisabeth ""living vicariously"" through Sue and, perhaps naively, letting her ""off the hook"" for so long, wrt abuse of the Stabilizer, she didn't, like, at some point, decide to ""take revenge"" on Sue, to some extent, and start abusing the Stabilizer \*herself\*, perhaps only switching a month later than she should've (and, thusly, quite-possibly become a lot more-youthful in the process *while conscious as Elisabeth, thereby allowing Elisabeth to also, ""have some of the fun""*)

Like, after Elisabeth had that phone call with the guy at the Substance company (after her leg got all fucked-up, if memory serves), I thought, ""Surely, at this point, she'll WAKE TF UP and stop hoping/assuming that Sue will, get her shit together and 'respect the process'?""  But... like a ""dumbass"", Elisabeth just hopes for the best and lets Sue screw her over more and more.

I couldn't help but wonder, ""Might the movie also work well, to some extent, *if* the people who made it, rather, had Elisabeth start abusing the process *herself* a bit, if only to get revenge on Sue and show her, 'This is what happens if you fuck with and take advantage of me!  Don't push your luck!'?""  Imho, the movie could've been just as interesting, quite possibly, if they added an element of, ""inter-consciousness"" or ""inter-body"" conflict between Sue and Elisabeth, after Elisabeth decided to start abusing the Stabilizer like Sue did for so long.  Like a sort of ""Stabilizer/youth arms race"", so to speak... until they ultimately ""fuck up too much"" and go to a 'point of no return' anyway

Some might argue that it would ""detract"" from the overall message or meaning of the film, but... would it, necessarily (if done right)?  Still, for Elisabeth, presumably, to be written in such a way as to ""not even consider"", at the very least, abusing the Stabilizer with Sue, seems like a missed opportunity?  If any one of us were Elisabeth, we'd probably ask ourselves, ""Why not fight fire with fire"", at some point?

Then again, for all we know, maybe the studio and writers *did*, in fact, consider that as a plot point but rejected it?  I guess we can only speculate on that...

Or did I miss something and, in fact, it was the case that the ""Stabilizer youthfulness"", for the 2, only went one way (i.e. Sue being able to extract more Stabilizer to stay conscious \*and\* be very-youthful, whereas, perhaps, Elisabeth didn't quite have the option of being able to ""become more youthful"" and/or stay conscious beyond the week-long period by abusing)? Like, in theory, when the 2 became ""totally separate"" individuals, why wouldn't we have reason to believe that Sue's ""essence"" was also ""ripe for the taking"", just as Sue had done to Elisabeth?",2,4,1752036444.0,Discussion,0.62,True,False,JohnEGirlsBravo,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lva1ze/the_substance_abuse_of_stabilizer/,new,low

The movie was from the 2000s, and it was Balkan (Maybe bosnian) set on the Austrian border, I think. All I clearly remember is that it was definitely set on a border.

The premise is that a man tries to get his terminally ill brother across the border so he can receive treatment , but he can’t because his brother doesn’t have the correct papers. Because of this, he starts crying while trying to comfort his brother. One of the guards wants to let him through, but his superior won’t allow it.

The landscape, to my knowledge, featured lots of mountains. I believe the film was either made in the late '90s or early 2000s. I remember seeing it on TikTok and then looking it up on YouTube, where I watched it. However, I’ve since tried using ChatGPT and checking my search history, and I still can’t find anything.

If anyone could help, I’d be very grateful

Pet Semetary (2015) 

I hear the original ending was where he and his son were living while his wife and daughter were undead.

I wanted that ending because it felt like a harder consequence for what he did

Death Becomes Her (1992) original ending I like better than what they used. Both are still gorgeous 59 Years Later because the potion they took doesn't let them age, sitting on a balcony asking what they should do

London? We've done London so many times Paris? We went three years ago and saw everything. 

They then see an old couple, Ernest w his wife. He holds her hand gently with love in his eyes the years have brought them

Madeline: Aren't you glad that's not us? 

Helen: (Longingly, her tone betraying her) Yeah

That was a more poignant ending, but it was a tonal shift I don't think they wanted. Yet I think it could've worked so well

movies,1lv2udy,Is having some characters die really that necessary if you want to have tension?,"Some of the complaints I've seen, mostly in movies, are when it comes to action scenes, or any type of scene that is supposed to be tense, people can't feel the tension because a) the story doesn't kill off any character, b) the story is killing only the characters with the least amount of characterization, c) the main characters get killed only if they allow that to happen (e.g. a self-sacrifice). And people tend not to feel tension during these scenes. I am especially seeing this right now with the discourse around Jurassic World: Rebirth.

Now, I do agree that killing off main characters helps raise the stakes of the story... Am I the only one who doesn't feel the need to have MCs getting killed? I mean, I get that it is a great plot device for making tension, but isn't it enough to show that death in the story is possible, or that at least the characters can get hurt? And I did experience tension in movies due to the situations looking very hard to survive from.

Am I not used to this trope enough, and that's why I can feel tension even without MCs dying, or killing off important characters isn't the only way tension can be built?

1. Award Winner - One Must Be a film for which the actor received an Awards nomination, be it Academy Awards or Golden Globes

2. Box Office Smash – Need to have Made 200 Million at the Box Office 

3. Two Hander – A movie where the actor stars opposite another major movie star

4. Auteur Turn – A movie where the actor works with an Auteur Director 

5. Comedy – Every serious Actor of the last 40 years – This doesn’t mean the movie itself necessarily is a comedy, but the Actor has to give a comedic performance, intentionally or not. 

6. Bit Part – This Can be either a brief cameo appearance in the movie or an appearance as part of a larger ensemble

7. Flop – Even our biggest stars have a few flops interspersed throughout their careers and Hackman is so different – the key to this category is choosing a FLOP that is still somehow watchable
 
8. Wild Cards- Dealer's choice

9. Wild Card – Dealer's choice.

movies,1luyzd0,Why Paul Mescal worked in gladiator II,"Now I'm aware there are many different opinions on the film itself, and on that, I'm a bit conflicted.  
I personally thought all that water CGI fest was too much.

However, Paul Mescal was brilliant, and it took me a while to figure out why I liked him in it.  
Knowing Ridley Scott, I went into this film not expecting a lot of deep character work.  
We have bad guys and good guys in Ridley Scott films.

We also had that in this, but Paul layered his hero portrayal with something that Russell Crowe didn't.  
The ""nothing to lose"" part is something he really shined through.

Paul's character is dangerous; he is not a classic hero—you want to stay out of his way.  
He felt unsafe, and it was refreshing compared to the classic 'hero of the story' to have a guy that made you a little uneasy.

I credit all this to Paul's performance because the script and movie make a big deal out of him being a hero.

But Paul added some recklessness and danger to that, in my opinion, that made the portrayal really strong.

movies,1luy53s,I hated 17 again.,"I hated 17 Again.

You all know this. It’s a summer day—a really tiring summer day—and you’re just sitting on the couch, bored as hell, wondering what you’re gonna do with your life. So you open Netflix, start scrolling, and then you see this: Seventeen Again. It’s a really old movie. But you decide, hmm, what do I have to lose? Apparently everything.

Starting that movie, it was fine. At least, that’s what I thought. But nooooo. The first few beginning minutes were like, oh, I feel a little bad for the main character, but, you know, he kind of had it coming. Because what do you mean you’re doing unprotected boombayah at 17? Who does that? Well, nowadays people do that, but the movie was from, like, back in 2015 and stuff. But like, let’s be real. Let’s freak it up a bit.

So I watch it, wondering, hmm, maybe it’s gonna get better. Then he becomes 17 again—like the title says—goes back to school, and there, I meet the most hated character in my life.

Oh wait—maybe I was a little too hasty. Let’s go back a little. In the beginning scenes, we’re introduced to the main character’s family: the mom (they’re about to divorce) and his two children. We get undertones of how unhappy they are with their father. Like, yeah, you know, typical pre-divorce situation. All that stuff. But besides that, those two characters? I don’t even deign -remember their names. I was like, hmm, maybe they’re gonna be a big part of the story.

So, let’s go back again. When he turns 17 again and goes back to school, he meets his son. He acts awkward, the son runs away, all that. But I’m talking about the bathroom scene—where he sees his son being taped to a chair or toilet or whatever. And I’m like, wait, maybe he’s gonna learn that his son is being bullied and help him. That’s gonna be the gist of the story—how family matters the most.

And then I was like, okay, yeah, but NO. Yeah, it’s about that—but I then have to find out that his main bully is dating his sister.

Y’all remember that he had a son and a daughter, right? Yes, that’s what happened. He has a son and a daughter. The son is being bullied, and the daughter is dating the bully. Because I remember looking at that and I was shook. I was shook. I was shook. I was baffled.

And I remember reading a story on Reddit about how this girl got bullied by a guy, and her sister still decided to date him—and how she cut contact because of that. And I’m saying: this movie does not address it at all.

Like, why is your sister dating your bully? Why is she not doing anything about it? That’s not even the tip of the iceberg. And let me not even get started on the uncomfortable relationship between the guy—who now appears as a teen—and the mom.

Because I get it… not really, I don’t. I don’t get it. But like, yes, the dad knows that he’s internally an adult. But the mom doesn’t. She sees him as a teenager. Like, the literal 17-year-old he looks like. But still, there are undertones of romance in their interactions whenever they meet, and that’s weird. Awkward. Disgusting. I don’t like it. I hated it.

And I can rant and rant and rant about how much I hated it, but the part that pissed me off the most was how they never addressed how what the sister was doing was wrong.

She’s not a good person. Imagine your sibling is getting bullied—and the person bullying them is your boyfriend—and you know he’s doing it. He does it in front of you. Somehow, you still let it happen.

And I hated it. I hated it, I hated it, I hated it. That’s why I hated that damn movie.

Well, with all the other problematic things inside, the only normal person in that movie is the brother. Because he’s the only one who had a normal relationship—with the girl he liked and everything.

And I’m just saying—why? Why did the movie have to be so weird? And this is the reason why I do not like 17 Again.

So I was talking to my sister about how whatever was going on in the movie producer’s head was not it—especially with where they decided to place the romance. And then, when I pointed out that the relationship between the main character and his ex—or soon-to-be ex-wife—was weird because he has the form of a teenage boy, she was like, “I don’t see the problem.”

And I’m like, what do you mean? I said, imagine she kissed him when he was in that teenage form.

She was like, “Well, he’s still her husband.”

I’m like, so imagine you were a 36-year-old woman, and your husband became 17 again. You would still kiss him?

So am I wrong for thinking it’s weird? Or is she weird for thinking it’s fine?

Because like—what? Why are you people like this? Why does she think it’s normal? It’s not! ",0,19,1752003581.0,Discussion,0.15,True,False,Levi_riu_22,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1luy53s/i_hated_17_again/,new,low
movies,1luy3g8,"TIFU - took my wife on a date to see “From Hilde, With Love” - a short review.","This movie is billed as being a daring romance with elements of espionage - set during the resistance in Berlin during the Second World War. 

It is not. 

Spoilers -
While it is a very topical movie with a timely message, it is an extraordinarily depressing tale of one woman’s existence in Nazi prisons while she raises a baby while waiting the death penalty. Her romance with her husband is shown in flashbacks, but there is no chemistry between the leads and after he is executed, she just stoically gets on with it. Therefore, no romance. The espionage bit is basically just them typing in morse code, trying to reach the Soviets, but in the end their radio was too weak to send but a single message.  No thrilling espionage.

While it is pretty clear what Hilde’s fate is going to be, it is shown very starkly. 

I can’t really say I enjoyed it. It is very scary, because people were given the death penalty for basically putting up stickers over Nazi propaganda and listening to a certain radio programme. It isn’t too much of a stretch to see that pattern repeating itself. 

TLDR: good movie, but definitely NOT for a date and not what it says on the tin. ",64,8,1752003475.0,Discussion,0.75,True,False,DiscoPopStar,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1luy3g8/tifu_took_my_wife_on_a_date_to_see_from_hilde/,new,low

[Variety (80)](https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/)

>The super-busy quality of “Superman” works for it and, at times, against it. The movie rarely slows down long enough to allow its characters to meditate on their shifting realities. That’s one reason it falls short of the top tier of superhero cinema (“The Dark Knight,” “Superman II,” “The Batman,” “Guardians”). I’d characterize the film as next-level good (a roster that includes “Iron Man,” “Thor,” “Batman Begins,” “Captain America,” and the hugely underrated “Iron Man 3”). Yet watching “Superman,” we register the layered quality of the conflicts, and we’re drawn right inside them. Gunn constructs an intricate game of a superhero saga that’s arresting and touching, and occasionally exhausting, in equal measure

[The Hollywood Reporter (80)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-james-gunn-1236305764/)

>What matters most is that the movie is fun, pacy and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air sweetened by a deep affection for the material and boosted by a winning trio of leads.

[DEADLINE](https://deadline.com/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-reboot-1236450641/)

>Overall, Gunn might be trying to do too much here, basically throwing everything against the wall and hoping some of it sticks. More than enough does in this entertaining new direction, but at times *Superman* suffers from overload, much like Gunns’ *Guardians of the Galaxy* trilogy, which wore out its welcome with Vol. 3 where Rocket unfortunately got the *Babe: Pig in the City* treatment. Nevertheless he is a talented and skilled director, no question, and one with optimism himself. It will be interesting to see where the future lies for DC under his (and Safran’s) more hopeful vision.

[Indiewire (58)](https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/superman-movie-review-james-gunn-1235137386/)

>Gunn is right to recognize that a certain amount of silliness is key to Superman’s charm, but here it mostly just distracts from the seriousness of what’s at stake. It’s hard to make a comic book come to life at the same time as you’re trying to bring life into a comic book, just as it’s hard not to admire Gunn for trying. But it’s even harder to care if a man can fly when there isn’t any gravity to the world around him. Grade: C+

[IGN (8)](https://www.ign.com/articles/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-nicholas-hoult)

>Superman is a wonderfully entertaining, heartfelt cinematic reset for the Man of Steel, and a great new start for the DC universe on the big screen.

[The Atlantic (90)](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/07/superman-movie-2025-review/683462/)

>The First Superman Movie Worth Watching in Years. The newest take on the caped hero wisely embraces his corniness.

[Consequence (83)](https://consequence.net/2025/07/superman-review-james-gunn-2025/)

>Grim and gritty are words this movie firmly rejects, instead leaning into the human side of everyone involved, even its villains. There are a few choices that work less well than others, but the end result is a movie that doesn't sacrifice its titular character in service to franchise-building. Instead, it focuses on celebrating the values that Superman himself has embodied from the beginning.

[Collider (80)](https://collider.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-dc-david-corenswet/)

>Superman is a magnificent feat, a film that makes the Man of Steel fascinating in a way we’ve rarely seen on film, with a take on the hero that is trenchant, clever, and delightful. Gunn is paying tribute to the past while also making a very clear mark on this world’s future, crafting an introduction to the DCU that inherently makes the viewer want to know where this world goes from here. At this point, it’s rare for superhero films to give a sense of wonder and a reminder of how beautiful these films can be when executed well. But Gunn has brought optimism, hope, and care back to Superman. It ends up becoming one of the best DC films in years, and one of the best movies of the summer.

[The Guardian - UK (2/5)](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn)

>From the very beginning, this new Superman is encumbered by a pointless and cluttered new backstory which has to be explained in many wearisome intertitles flashed up on screen before anything happens at all. Only the repeated and laborious quotation of the great John Williams theme from the 1978 original reminds you of happier times.

[The Wrap (88)](https://www.thewrap.com/superman-2025-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet/)

>A fabulously smart and entertaining film whose flaws stem from trying too hard… which are the best flaws a film can have.

[Entertainment Weekly (67)](https://ew.com/superman-review-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-soar-kryptonite-script-11768207)

>Whether Gunn fell victim to the kryptonite of excessive studio notes, his desire to populate the film with his stalwart company of actors, or the hubris of not needing to offer reasons to be invested in these characters beyond the mere fact of their existence is unclear. Because there is an unquestionable love for the material and a passion for the goofier, larger-than-life scenarios of comic book lore. With a cast this excellent, there's a capacity for something truly super in a future film — if only Gunn chooses to put the characters' humanity first. **Grade: B-**

[BBC (3/5)](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20250708-superman-review)

>It's a shame that Gunn didn't give his story more time to breathe. It's a shame, in particular, that he didn't devote more time to showing us that Superman really is the paragon that his supporters keep saying he is. Corenswet is well cast – he has plenty of all-American charm both as Superman and as his mild-mannered alter ego, Clark Kent – but we have to take it on trust that he is a selfless gentleman who helps his friends and enjoys Lois Lane's company. We don't see any of that. Indeed, Corenswet plays him as an oddly hot-headed manchild who can't get through a conversation with his girlfriend without shouting angrily at her. Was Gunn racing through his material so fast that he forgot to put in the scenes that show Superman's sweeter and nobler side? Maybe so. In a film that whirls with flying dogs and bright green baby demons, the most bizarre element is a Man of Steel who keeps having meltdowns.

[Empire Magazine - UK (2/5)](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/superman-2025/)

>David Corenswet takes on the blue-and-red mantle admirably, and glimpses of Gunn’s signature sense of fun shine through — but a lack of humanity, originality and cohesion means the movie around them just doesn’t work.

[Rolling Stone (80)](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-dc-universe-1235374965/)

>It’s faint praise, even in the post-MCU era of the genre, to say that Superman is a solid superhero film; the caveat is hiding in plain sight. What Gunn has pulled off is something more complicated, more interesting, and far tougher: He’s given us a Superman movie that actually feels like a living, breathing comic book.

[SlashFilm (80)](https://www.slashfilm.com/1906722/superman-james-gunn-movie-review/)

>Yes, ""Superman"" is a frequently corny movie because Superman is a corny character, a Kansas farm boy alien who saves squirrels in danger and listens to lame pop music. There's nothing grim or dark here, just a real sense of entertaining silliness that left a big, stupid smile on my face. In our current media landscape, such an approach feels surprisingly bold.

[Independent - UK (4/5)](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-b2782165.html)

>David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan and Nicholas Hoult lead a movie that doesn’t just serve as a referendum for superhero films, but for the cinematic future of DC as a whole.

[New York Times (90)](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html)

>As both a story on its own and a prequel to a whole bunch of others, this movie must introduce us to a variety of characters we’ll meet later, and it does it without feeling too much like fan service or exposition.

[Vulture (90)](https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html)

>There’s a lot about how we complicate and obfuscate what should be obvious goods, such as saving the lives of children. But the film’s approach isn’t ham-fisted, and it makes room for gleefully fun stuff, too.

[The Times - UK (2/5)](https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/superman-film-review-david-corenswet-vbzrgpdhh)

>This migraine of a movie is superhero soup. David Corenswet is serviceable as Hollywood’s latest Man of Steel, but director James Gunn has turned the ninth big-screen film into an indigestible mush

[The Irish Times (2/5)](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/review/2025/07/08/superman-review-utterly-charmless-and-as-funny-as-toothache/)

>The cartoonish closing battles make it clear that, not for the first time, Gunn is striving for high trash, but what he achieves here is low garbage. Utterly charmless. Devoid of humanity. As funny as toothache.

movies,1luukji,"The more I watch Lewis Pullman, the more blown away I am","I made a post a while back about Lewis Pullman but I wanted  to come back and update because I keep being more and more blown away by him.

Like I mentioned before, I was first introduced to him through Top Gun Maverick. Even with limited screen time, he completely owned that role. There was something so endearing and sweetly innocent in his performance that really stood out. It’s rare for a “smaller” role to leave such a lasting impression, but he did just that.

Recently I watched The Starling Girl, and wow that performance really blew me away. His acting chops were fully on display. I love how understated he is while still bringing so much depth, passion and emotion. He never overplays it, but the impact lands hard.

I’ve also now watched Outer Range thanks to recommendations- what a cast, what a plot. Everyone was brilliant (Josh Brolin is a total badass), but once again I found myself especially drawn to Lewis’s character and screen presence.

I also really enjoyed what he brought to his character in Skincare. I love Elizabeth Banks, and this was very different from his other roles- more bold, eccentric, and slightly unhinged. But he still made it feel natural and believable, in that effortless understated signature Lewis Pullman way.

There’s something so lovely about watching him work. He says a lot without having to say a lot. I know this post is wordy and the opposite of that but I had to put it out there because he really deserves the recognition.

I genuinely hope he stays grounded and doesn’t get tainted by the industry. He seems like a kind person with integrity and that really comes through in interviews and the roles he chooses.

I haven’t seen all of his work yet, but I’m enjoying working through it. Everything I’ve seen so far has stayed with me. He brings a quiet sincerity and charm that’s rare.

I’m excited to see what he does next. He’s definitely one to watch and I think he should be so incredibly proud of himself. I love that his choices lean toward thoughtful interesting challenging stories and complex characters rather than flashy blockbusters. I hope he keeps following that path and stays true to himself, it’s clearly working.

For context: I’m in my 30s and pretty old school having spent a lot of my life really influenced by my dad and having shared passions. I usually don’t connect much with younger talent (no disrespect, just personal taste, I tend to gravitate toward older generation actors and musicians). But Lewis Pullman is definitely an exception. There’s something quietly special about what he brings and it really sticks with you. It definitely sticks with me.

If anyone has any recommendations or insights to share please do!? I’d love to hear more about his work. 
I’d honestly love to tell him all this in person someday, just so he knows the impression he’s leaving on people and his audience, but I hope he already knows. His parents must without a doubt be so proud of him

**Bio and more information:**

From Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy Award-winning writer/producer/director Larry Charles, COMEDY SAMURAI: 40 YEARS OF BLOOD, GUTS, AND LAUGHTER is a rollicking journey through modern American comedy, as he shares behind-the-scenes stories from his life\&#39;s work.

Grand Central will publish Charles’s memoir on June 17, 2025. To tell Larry Charles’s life story is to tell the story of modern American comedy. Over the last 40 years, few comedians have been a part of so many iconic, beloved projects. Larry was one of the original writers and producers on the first five seasons of Seinfeld, executive produced both Curb Your

Enthusiasm and Entourage while directing 18 episodes of Curb and served as the showrunner for Mad About You. His film directing credits include Borat, Bruno, and The Dictator, the comic documentary Religulous (starring Bill Maher), and Masked and Anonymous (which he co-wrote with Bob Dylan who stars).

In Comedy Samurai, Charles pulls back the curtain on the making of his successful projects, offering sharp, never-before-told anecdotes about Jerry Seinfeld, Sacha Baron Cohen, Bill Maher, Bob Dylan, Nic Cage, Mel Brooks, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, and Larry David, among many others.

Larry Charles rose from the mean streets of Brooklyn and the working-class housing projects of Donald Trump’s nefarious father Fred, to become the director of Borat, Bruno, The Dictator and Religulous amongst others. He directed Bob Dylan and an all-star cast (Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Jessica Lange and Penelope Cruz among others) in the film, Masked an Anonymous which he and Dylan wrote together. He has also directed numerous episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm and was one of the original writers and producers of Seinfeld. Larry is a Peabody, Golden Globe, and Emmy-award winner. Since the Malibu fires, he, and his wife and two dogs are vagabonds.

movies,1lumfmn,"Kurt Vonnegut's novels that have been adapted to the big screen: Slaughterhouse-Five (1972), Mother Night (1996) and Breakfast of Champions (1999).","Kurt Vonnegut is easily one of my favorite authors. So it goes. His novels have both made me laugh out and loud as well as shed tears. I took it upon myself to look at the 3 adaptions of his novels with *Slaughterhouse-Five,* *Mother* *Night* and *Breakfast* *of* *Champions* and look at how they went about adapting Vonnegut's unique voice and what may have been lost in adaption.

First, we have *Slaughterhouse*\-*Five*, easily Vonnegut's most well-known and read novel, one that has a big place in literary history. The novel, concerning the character of Billy Pilgrim being ""unstuck in time"" and based on the real-life bombing of Dresden (which Vonnegut witnessed as a POW), was released in 1969, proving to be such a hit that it was turned into a film only 3 years later. The film adaption would be directed by George Roy Hill, best known for *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* (1969), for which he won the Oscar for Best Director. The film adaption was well received by critics, winning the *Prix du Jury* at the Cannes Film Festival. So it goes. Even more of a glowing commendation came from Vonnegut himself, who said he couldn't be happier with how his novel was adapted. Watching the film and I am impressed by how closely they stuck to the novel and the casting was pretty damn good. However, I find that it's one of those films that fails to live up the heights of the novel, especially when it came to how I pictured certain parts and characters as I read it. I'd recommend it to fans of the novel, with the caveat that it isn't the same as reading the novel.

Secondly, we have *Mother* *Night*, which has the biggest gap from the novel to the film adaption of Vonnegut's works, with the novel being published in 1962 and the film being released in 1996. The novel is about Howard W. Campbell Jr., an American who lives in Germany with his family since post-WW1, who becomes recruited by American Intelligence to become a double-agent, broadcasting Nazi Propaganda while secretly communicating with the Americans about Nazi plans. The film was directed by Keith Gordon, who is most known for his role as Archie Cunningham in *Christine* (1983), but had directed a few indie flicks before adapting Mother Night. This is my favorite adaption of the 3 films and it's especially due to Nick Nolte's fantastic performance as Howard W. Campbell Jr. Nolte brings his trademark rage and sense of self-loathing to the role with aplomb. Nolte really makes this a one-man show but their are some nice supporting performances by Sheryl Lee, Alan Arkin, Frankie Faison and John Goodman. This adaption was also well received by critics and Vonnegut also commended the film for how it adapted his novel. So it goes. 

Finally, we have *Breakfast of Champions*, the novel being published in 1973 and the film being released in 1999. The novel and film concerns itself with Dwayne Hoover, a well respected businessman whose mental health deteriorates over the course of the novel; the novel also looks at the city Dwayne lives in, Midland City, as well as exploring the various people that make up the city; also, the novel feature Kilgore Trout, the biggest reoccurring character in Vonnegut's 'Verse, who's a curmudgeonly writer on his way to Midland City for an Arts Festival. The film was directed by Alan Rudolph, a longtime director of indie films in various genres. The film was roundly panned by critics. So it goes. I find this adaption to be the most frustrating, as while it has some of comedy of the novel, it completely misses the pathos. The film also suffers from changing various elements of the novel, cutting out crucial scenes of adding whole new ones. Despite the overall disappointment I found in the film, I did come away liking some of the performances. I thought Bruce Willis did a fair job at portraying Dwayne Hoover as Willis used some of his natural comedic timing to pull off Hoover's decreasing mental state. The incomparable Albert Finney does well in the time he's given as Kilgore Trout. Nick Nolte gets the chance to play a zanier role as the crossdressing Harry LeSabre, with Nolte really excelling with the comedic bits.

movies,1luj74t,Somehing felt weird watching the last Mission Impossible movie,"^(Obligatory sorry for weird english)

I went to see the last Mission Impossible movie with my father last sunday, in a theater in France. In this movie, countries with nuclear weapons are mentionned often, and there are maybe three or four moments when we see a serie of flags being shown quickly (if you saw the movie, you know what I'm referring to).

Now, the first time this happened in the movie, I thought I missed the French flag. Maybe I blinked at the wrong moment. Then it happens a second time and there, I pay attention : no French flag!

Wait, it's weird, why would they show the 6 or 7 other flags but not the French one? 

Then all the other moments when this shot is shown in the movie, I really pay close attentin : no French flag. I am sure of it.

So now I'm wondering : did they forget about it? I don't think so. Is it considered wrong to show the flag of the country where the film is being shown on a >!nuclear missile!<? 

It made me wonder if in other countries, the same thing happened with the local flag. So if you're living in the US, UK, Israel, Pakistan, India, China, Russia... or North Korea but I'm not confident on getting answers from there... Did you notice something off with the flags? Or was the French flag missing in your movies too?

movies,1luj3qw,"Which actors do you only ever see as themselves, and which completely disappear into their roles?","Had a chat with my fam about this the other night while watching a film. For whatever reason, with some actors, no matter what film I’m watching with them in it, I don’t see the character, I just see the actor.


Sometimes it’s because they basically play themselves every time, or they’re typecast into the same type of role over and over. Other times it’s just their massive star power overshadowing the entire film.


For example, Marilyn Monroe - one of the earliest examples of this. Hell yeah, she was a great actress, but in every film, all I see is Marilyn. I can never even remember her characters’ names because it’s just her.


Perfect example: Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson...he’s been playing himself since the mid-2000s. imo Jack Black too. Jeff Goldblum feels like he’s parodying himself these days. And as much as I love Bruce Willis (😢) after Die Hard, 90% of his roles felt like slight variations of a cavalier John McClane. Pacino too - after Scent of a Woman, all I see is Pacino being Pacino. Watching Tom Cruise in a movie these days feels like Tom Cruise doing cool Tom Cruise things, and as hilarious as I find Ryan Reynolds, Deadpool is basically Van Wilder in a suit. I don't mean to bash on any of them at all, I've enjoyed every single one, i just thought it interesting to point out. 


But then you've got absolute superstars like DiCaprio, one of the most recognizable faces on the planet, yet when I watch his movies, I don’t see Leo, I see his characters. Same with guys like Daniel Day-Lewis, Gary Oldman, and Christian Bale, who completely vanish into whoever they’re playing.


Funny enough, Johnny Depp used to be on that list for me. the king of vanishing into a role. But now, even though he looks nothing like himself under all that makeup, i'm still sitting there in the theatre like: “yep, that’s Johnny Depp doing his thing.”


Nicolas Cage is the wildcard. Sometimes I can’t get past that it’s just Nic Cage being Nic Cage, other times his performance is so phenomenal I completely forget it’s him...or maybe because it’s actually John Travolta, playing Nic Cage, playing John Travolta…


What about you guys? Which actors can you never unsee, and which ones completely vanish into their characters for you?",257,469,1751962591.0,Question,0.82,True,False,Agile-Tie-7433,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1luj3qw/which_actors_do_you_only_ever_see_as_themselves/,new,low

(Fight scenes),"Their are some fight scenes in movies/shows I’ve seen where the fight goes from one part of an area too an entirely different part of the area and it’s typical because one fighter is being defensive while backing away from the aggressive fighter.

Examples:

Anakin vs Obi Wan Kenobi 

Jack Reacher vs Paulie 

John wick vs Cassian (first fight) 

Sonic vs Shadow (last fight) 

Peter vs the chicken (almost all their fights lol)

movies,1luip12,"Please recommend a ""Once in a Year"" best movie from 2019-2024","Hello!

I'm currently looking for movie recommendations. Specifically, I'm interested in some of the very best movies released each year between 2019 and 2024. If you have any personal favourites or films that are critically acclaimed, I’d really appreciate your suggestions.

To give you a better idea of my taste, here are a few films I’ve watched recently that I absolutely loved!

* Dune: Part One
* Dune: Part Two
* Godzilla Minus One
* Parasite
* Oppenheimer

These films stood out to me not only because of their compelling stories, but also due to their exceptional cinematography, immersive world-building, powerful storytelling, and beautiful colour grading. Mainly the colour grading. I really love movies that are visually stunning, and emotionally driven. Bonus if it's scifi, I am not too interested in ""grounded"" type films, I find Oppenheimer to be an exception due to the larger than life scale of the nature of the film.

I’m looking to create watchlist of films that represents the pinnacle of cinema for each year. So if there are movies that you feel were  standout films from 2019 through to 2024, I’d love to hear about them.

I may have come in with way too high expectations, but it really just felt like an ok movie, nothing special.

Don't get me wrong, the cinematography is one of the best I have EVER seen in any movie, but the actual story? Many plot points felt rushed, like Mia literally cheated on her boyfriend for some bum she met a week ago just cuz she heard him play piano well. That whole sequence felt so weird, and I genuinely thought I missed an hour of the movie, cuz how are they just gonna move past all that so fast?

The characters didn't have much built up either, all their development revolved around their jobs and not really about them as people or their relationship.

After that beginning sequence, and we start time skipping, the story makes more sense and is alright, but still feels like a very basic romance (starts with puppy love, climaxes at some major conflict, then resolves).

Yesterday was the first day with Afghanistan. Today is Bahrain. I skipped Armenia and Azerbaijan because they were already done by u/Impossible_Werewolf8 who included them in their European movie tour that I was inspired by.

Our first day winner, from Afghanistan, is **Osama (2004) directed by Siddiq Barmak.** This was one of the first movies made entirely in and about Afghanistan directly after the Taliban lost control in 2001. Sadly, the Taliban being in control again means the outright ban on movies, music, and anything secular. Hopefully someday we will get more emotionally arresting films like this. If you want to watch it without pirating, this is available on Amazon Prime Video and has English subtitles.

I hadn't heard of Osama or a few others mentioned and that is my hope for everyone interested in following along with this project. To find non mainstream movies from different cultures with different languages.

Okay let's do **Bahrain.**

The rules (i added II and III today for clarifications):

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Mainstream American made movies are totally okay, but let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted.

II) Animated movies are okay but not documentaries.

III) On ties I'll just pick the movie with less reviews on imdb to spotlight the lesser known films.

IV) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment.

It was a weekend for fireworks and dinosaurs.

***Jurassic World Rebirth*** opened with a monster $322 million worldwide, showing there's still power in this franchise after 30 years. And while ***F1*** took a rough drop in the domestic market, it's still a hit overseas, as the film is nearing $300 million worldwide and officially became Apple's highest grossing film ever.

The Top 10 earned a combined $152 million this weekend. That's 0.2% up from last year, when ***Despicable Me 4*** debuted atop.

Debuting at #1, ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** debuted with $92 million in 4,308 theaters. Adding in its numbers from Wednesday and Thurday, the film earned an incredible $147.8 million. This is hard to compare with the previous ***Jurassic World*** films, as all films opened on Friday. So just for reference; ***Fallen Kingdom*** earned $148 million on its first 3 days, and ***Dominion*** made $145 million.

What does this debut suggest? What everyone always knew: people love dinosaurs. And that has always been the franchise's biggest advantage. There are no other dino franchises currently, which has allowed Universal to cater to an audience that wants to see these monsters in the big screen. There's a lot of franchises that have experienced fatigue, but the ***Jurassic*** clearly is still beloved 32 years later after its debut in theaters.

The film had a very rushed production; it was officially announced in January 2024, although a script was written for quite some time. Gareth Edwards was hired one month later, when the current release date was already set. So basically the film was reported, filmed and released in the span of just 18 months. That's very short for a blockbuster. But then again, audiences don't pay much attention to productions. What they care for is if the film looks interesting or catches their interest, and Universal achieved it. They sold it as a ""back to basics"" film, choosing to just abandon all characters from the prior films and focus on new characters, played by Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey. Turns it out all worked out.

According to Universal, 61% of the audience was male. The films are popular with families, although ***Rebirth*** starts to point that it's losing some young audience members. Only 36% of the audience was 25 and under, which is below ***Fallen Kingdom*** (56%) and ***Dominion*** (41%). At the end of the day, that's pretty much imminent when your franchise is 30 years old.

So yes, everything worked out in the end. Well, almost everything. What did ***Rebirth*** fail at? Reception. Critics were unimpressed with the film, giving it a mediocre 52% on RT. Somehow, that was an improvement over the past two films, but that's still not a good score. Regardless, the debut suggests the audience was still excited to watch the film. But the film's word of mouth indicates that this will play very, very differently, and that's another thing were ***Rebirth*** failed.

Audiences gave ***Jurassic World Rebirth*** a very weak ""B"" on CinemaScore, which is very poor for a blockbuster. That's worse than any of the ***Jurassic World*** films, and it's the second lowest in the franchise, just above ***Jurassic Park III*** (""B–""). This is an indication that audiences are not content with the film. It's hard to point to a domestic total prediction given that this is a 5-day debut, but with high competition like ***Superman*** and ***The Fantastic Four: First Steps*** arriving, it's very likely the film will continue the franchise's decline at the box office. Definitely a success, but it's gonna put a lot of pressure on the next film.

Last week's champ ***F1*** added $25.7 million this weekend. That's a rough 55% drop from last week, but when you have a juggernaut like ***Jurassic World***, a drop like that is pretty much imminent. Through 10 days, the film has amassed $109.2 million domestically, the first Apple title to hit that milestone. There's still heavy competition on its way, but ***F1*** should still have enough gas left to hit $160 million domestically.

In third place, ***How to Train Your Dragon*** dipped 43%, adding $11.2 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $224.2 million, finally becoming the franchise's biggest film in the domestic market.

There doesn't appear to be any signs of life in Disney/Pixar's ***Elio***. It dropped 45% and made just $5.7 million. That drop is barely better than last week, indicating word of mouth isn't really doing anything to save the film. The film has made an abysmal $55 million so far, and it's going to struggle to hit $65 million at this rate.

***28 Years Later*** remained at #5, although it still dropped 53% and added $4.5 million this weekend. At least that's better than last week's steep 67% drop, but it's still rough. The film has already earned $60.2 million, and it should finish with around $67 million domestically.

***M3GAN 2.0*** continued disappointing on its second weekend. The film collapsed a poor 61%, earning just $3.9 million this weekend. That's far worse than the original's second weekend drop (a very light 39.8%). The sequel has earned a very poor $18.7 million, which is a colossal 68% behind the original through the same point. With more competition on its way, it's highly likely the film will finish with less than $25 million domestically.

***Lilo & Stitch*** dropped 45% and earned $3.8 million. The film has amassed $408.5 million so far.

In eighth place, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** eased just 34% and added $2.7 million this weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $191.1 million, and it will soon pass ***Rogue Nation*** ($195 million) to become the fourth biggest film in the franchise.

***Materialists*** had another rough drop this weekend. This time, it dropped 55% and added $1.3 million. That took its total to $33.5 million.

Rounding out the Top 10 was the 41st anniversary re-release of ***This Is Spinal Tap***. It earned $1 million from 1,015 theaters, taking its lifetime gross to $5.7 million. Man, it should've made $1.1 million, come on.

#**OVERSEAS**

***Jurassic World Rebirth*** debuted with $174 million overseas, for a monster $322.6 million worldwide debut. China was its biggest debut with $41.5 million, which is the biggest for a Hollywood title this year. However, it should be noted that the film was quite front-loaded in the market amidst poor word of mouth. Other strong debuts were seen in the UK ($16.6M), Mexico ($13.9M), Germany ($7.6M), South Korea ($7.4M), Spain ($6.5M), Australia ($5.9M), India ($5.5M/best of franchise), France ($5.3M) and Italy ($4.7M).

All the ***Jurassic World*** films have cracked $1 billion, but don't expect the same to happen to ***Rebirth***. Not only was it lower than ***Dominion*** $392 million worldwide debut, but most of these debuts were all from 5-day debuts, which is boosting its numbers. For now, a $800 million worldwide total is likely. Another success in the franchise, but it will continue marking another decline.

***F1*** was impacted domestically, but it continues killing it overseas. Despite the arrival of ***Rebirth***, the film dipped just 38% and added $56.3 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $293 million. It's already Apple's biggest film worldwide. In China, the film had an insane 2% second weekend drop, which is the best for a Hollywood title this year, and now the film is set to massively over-perform in the market. The best markets are China ($22M), the UK ($17.3M), Mexico ($12.3M), France ($11.5M) and Australia ($9.8M). Assuming it keeps holding very well, the film should definitely pass $450 million worldwide.

***How to Train Your Dragon*** added $21 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $519 million. The best markets are China ($35.5M), Mexico ($33.4M), the UK ($24.6M), Brazil ($17.2M) and France ($14.2M). It has already passed the original film's worldwide gross, and by tomorrow it will pass ***The Hidden World*** ($520 million).

***28 Years Later*** added $7 million overseas, allowing it to cross $125 million worldwide. The UK has been its biggest market, unsurprisingly, earning $17 million so far. The film should finish with around $140 million worldwide.

Continuing its absolutely pathetic run in pretty much every territory, Disney/Pixar's ***Elio*** made $6.7 overseas, taking its worldwide total to just $97.7 million worldwide. The best markets are France ($4.7M), the UK ($4.1M), South Korea ($3.6M), China ($3.5M) and Mexico ($2.8M). 3 weeks in and a Pixar title still hasn't cracked $100 million worldwide. What a time to be alive.

***Lilo & Stitch*** added $6.1 overseas, taking its worldwide total to $972 million. That allowed it to finally pass ***A Minecraft Movie*** as the year's second highest grossing film, just behind ***Ne Zha 2***. The best markets are Mexico ($66.5M), the UK ($48.3M), France ($40.5M), Brazil ($36.5M) and Germany ($30.8M).

With $3.9 million overseas, ***Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning*** has officially passed ***Dead Reckoning*** worldwide with a $576.1 million total, becoming the fourth biggest film in the franchise.

#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEK**

Movie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |
----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:
*A Minecraft Movie* | Apr/4 | Warner Bros. | $162,753,003 | $423,949,195 | $954,928,702 | $150M

- *A Minecraft Movie* has closed its run with a fantastic $954 million worldwide. Considering the insanely negative response to its first teaser, it's still a sign of the brand's strength that it could make almost $1 billion. Of course, the film's legs were very mediocre (2.60x is not great at all for family films, given those easily pass 3x), which is a sign that they weren't fully satisfied by the film itself. Whenever the sequel comes up, they must deliver something better than this, quality-wise.

#**THIS WEEKEND**

A new era of DC begins this weekend.

That's because it's the arrival of DC's ***Superman***, the first film in the new DC Universe (DCU). Written and directed by James Gunn, it stars David Corensweet as the Man of Steel, and it follows Superman's journey to reconcile his alien heritage with his adoptive human family. To say that expectations are high for this film is selling it short. As previously mentioned, this is gonna kick off a new DC Universe, after the DCEU had the insane distinction of having 8 box office flops in a row. And that's not even including the absolute misfire of ***Joker: Folie à Deux***. Needless to say, the brand is at an all-time low and ***Superman*** will need to win over people. With a high $225 million budget and an extensive marketing campaign, this film really needs to be a home run for the sake of DC.

movies,1lu75vo,Is Directing more technical than creative?,"So I read the first few pages of the script of Lady Bird. I began picturing the opening scene like I would while reading a novel. The script didn't say it out loud but clearly the mother and daughter were talking fast, emotionally charged.

Upon seeing the actual opening scene, it was almost the same except the very first shot. Rest all were very similar to what I imagined.

This got me thinking, is directing really a creative task or more of a technical one. Is directing more about managing the crew to ""pull it off"" than being creative? Because I had heard that the script is just ""bare bones"", not as descriptive as a novel, hence the director has to give life to it by adding an emotional backdrop. But this feels strange because the script may not say the feeling out loud but it is quite obvious like the opening of Lady Bird.

For example the script didn't say that they were talking over each other fast, but it was very obvious.

I know the basic story is Emma Stone's character, Bella, being a child in the body of a grown woman. What I find weird is her sexual liberation, which okay... but like she's a child? Also the fact that she's having sex with a bunch of men. How is that empowering? The whole movie to me just seemed like men taking advantage (sexually) of a child. I don't really see how this is supposed to be feminist and ""freeing.""  I don't know, the whole film just seemed very pornographic and sad to me. I don't understand how this is being praised for its story. And I don't think anyone who disagrees with this film is a ""mysoginistic man.""

I will give it to them though, the cinematography, costumes, and performances are great. Other than that I think it's a weird film, and not in a good way. 

These are,  obviously, just my thoughts though. Someone help me understand the whole feminist view point.

I've got a few of 'em.

DRAGONSLAYER: I was 11 years old and a friend's mom took us.  The film is surprisingly rather brutal, and when we got to the scene where the baby dragons are eating the princess, she noped out of the film and we all had to leave.  I ended up seeing it a few weeks later when the film hit a second run theater (my brother took me).  Great movie.

JOES VS THE VOLCANO: My girlfriend at the time was hating it so we left shortly after Tom Hanks got onto the yacht.  She offered me positive inducement to leave so we did so.  I eventually saw it when it hit VHS and a few times since.  It's OK.

SPIDER-MAN: I was liking the film but something didn't agree with me from the meal I had prior to sitting down.  What I thought would be a quick bathroom break ended up running until the film ended.  I was loving the film up until the point that I left so I went and saw it the following weekend.  My wife, who was with me for the aborted viewing, loved the film and saw it again with me.  Great movie.  I know that critical consensus holds that the sequel is the best of the trilogy but I prefer that first one still.

About the plot, I was feeling confused that the bf didn't seem to know that she was a robot.   
I supposed that maybe he'd realize and reject her and she'd snap and go on a killing spree.  
I was pleased when it went in a rather different direction. I mean, from a moral point of view the whole thing of fake memories/identity is a huge no go (let alone being considered an object).  
But it was cool that actually she was the only normal person there.

When she raised her intelligence to 100% my expectations also went up.  
And when she kept acting rather silly it didn't feel right, it felt like if the writers were nerfing her for plot contrivance.  
Although this silliness did give room for that hilarious scene when she talks in German with the cop, unable to lie but he couldn't understand what she was saying,

But when she was captured, and all what happened afterwards, it didn't feel quite right anymore.  
Also the ""domestic abuse"" scenes with candle etc, it felt unnecessary, and it wasn't where I wished the movie to go.  
The male robot' suicide felt wrong too.  
And the finale felt rushed and not on spot, like if the plot had missed a chance for much more. Which is what I feel in general for the whole last third of the movie.

Plus, quite a few plot holes.  
\- Dude has the ability to mod such an advanced android and plans a murder and he doesn't even read the terms of use? Even without video recordings it's clear that the the manufacturer has a way to see if the product was tampered with.   
\- She has only wifi and visual stuff in the head, and yet she shuts off with a shot?  
Then she wakes up and she can still see and function perfectly?  
\- The dude of the robots company could give her complete freedom? What company would be so crazy to build androids which can be freed of every restriction with just a quick change of settings?  
And if he can do that much, how does he not have a vocal code to shut down Patrick when he was attacking him?  
\- Also, her running away like if she now has freedom, really?  
The company won't even investigate why she's missing? She doesn't have a GPS chip?  
Ex Machina does the ""getting freedom"" thing MUCH better.

  The way the astronauts slowly walked downt the pitch black moon ramp. The weird music kept on getting louder as they descend on the moon site.

movies,1ltwldr,The Legend of Bagger Vance is  brilliant,"You may have stumbled upon The Legend of Bagger Vance on the golf channel and thought “interesting concept to use golf as an analogy for life”. The movie makes some bad cinematic choices at times, and many of the plot points are unnecessary or don’t add much to the whole of thr movie. What makes this movie so brilliant in my opinion? It’s that the movie is based on the Hindu sacred text the Bhagavad Gita, in which Krishna tutors the warrior-hero Arjuna. 

It’s not easy to articulate what Brahman is according to Hinduism, or how one can attain experimental knowledge of it. In fact, intellectual understanding of Brahman is basically pointless, as it’s “not something that can be taught or learned, only remembered” as stated in Bagger Vance.

There are several key quotes that do an amazing job at hinting towards the truth of Brahman without being overly explanatory, and in fact the at times vague references to it promote inquiry on the viewer in the same way an actual guru would want to a illicit. Perhaps the best example of this is when Bagger Vance is talking to one of the tournament organizers about why Junuh hasn’t been playing well, and says it’s because “he still thinks he’s Rannulph Junuh”, to which the organizer says “he is Rannulph Junuh though!” and Bagger says “well…he is and he isn’t”. This is reffering to the idea that our ego and sense of separation from the whole of reality is an illusion, and that our true identity is Atman, our soul that is identical to Brahman.

Nearly every scene with Bagger Vance throughout the movie is layered with nods to Brahman, but in a way where you could watch the whole film and have no idea it’s alluding to Hinduism if you’re not aware of the philosophy, and I think that makes it one of the most special movies of all time.

movies,1ltqnp6,2001: A Space Odyssey,"I was loving the beginning of the movie and I can appreciate very much the production quality, the cinematography, the music and even the unrealistic sci-fi aspects! But if I wanted to experience what it feels like to be stuck in limbo for about 2 hours and then be tripping on psychedelics for about the last 10 minutes, I would spend my money on drugs instead! The entire film just feels like very very slow moving exposition which leads up to nothing meaningful. Open-ended is one thing, and I know that a well told story doesn't need to have resolution, but I seriously feel like I've had my time wasted even with the redeeming qualities! Even if everything about the obelisks/artifacts and the aliens was completely left unresolved, I would have appreciated a little bit more fast-paced and detailed world building, which would at least leave you intrigued or get you invested in this world. No means of propulsion visible or explained for any of the ships, no explanation as to how we got multi-story lunar bases and giant spinning space stations within 33 years of 1968, are those giant hangers pressurized at all (if not then what's the point of colossal closing gates which would be wildly inconvenient to build and if they are air locks then how do you pressurize such a vast space), how come they have a lunar city completed yet the space station is still under construction??? Okay fine you don't have to cover every single technological development if you're just focusing on the story but where is the progression? Proto-humans learn to wield sticks by touching an artifact, we have a giant rotating space station in 2001, lunar travel is routine and there's a city on the moon, they find the same artifact on the moon, it transmits something, they send a mission to Jupiter, AI dooms the mission, and the remaining astronaut finds a rectangle, has an acid trip, turns into giant fetus? Most of the time is spent showing off big machines with Strauss playing in the back. ""A trip to the moon"" had a longer story and the entire film is silent and less than 15 minutes long!

I mean am I missing something here?

The cinematography was phenomenal, the sound design was immaculate, the world building was almost okay, the storytelling and pacing leave much to be desired!

movies,1ltr36w,2001: A Space Odyssey - How Educated was the Audience?,"I'm by no means an engineer, let alone an expert on space, but I know a bit about physics - enough to understand Newton's laws. Enough to understand that an object flying through space on its way to Jupiter won't just wait for you if you leave it for a spacewalk and apply force to propel yourself in a different direction. If you want to return to the spaceship afterwards, you'll need to shoot yourself back in its direction and catch up. But in 2001: A Space Odyssey there are scenes in which the spaceship is treated as stationary, allowing the crew to meander about outside and then just return whenever they feel like it.

I understand that it's just a film, and there have been worse cases of botched space science (I'm lookihg at you Star Wars), but this especially surprised me because of the film's release date - wasn't 1968 the height of the space race? Weren't viewers more knowledgeable about how objects behave in space? 

Funnily enough, one of the film's main themes is that 'man is a baby in space,' so yes, you can expect the audience to not fully understand these things. But I don't think this was a deliberate mistake carried out to make a point, but rather an ironic proof of the concept, showing that even the filmmakers didn't understand the subject. 

I haven't seen anybody point this out. Was this discussed at all when the movie was released?

Edit: some of you are commenting about retaining the ship's velocity. Yes, of course you would retain its velocity, but I've specifically mentioned that the crew applied force to *propel itself away from the ship* and then didn't need to catch up to it.

movies,1ltmf6a,I think I finally understand No Country for Old Men for myself,"I've always loved this movie since I first saw it in theaters, but I think I've always struggled to connect with it thematically. Obviously the movie is subject to a wide variety of interpretation, but I saw it again last night and there were a couple of scenes that stood out to me this time:

1. The conversation Sheriff Ed Bell has with his brother. His brother brings up the point about having humility and warns Ed not to believe the world *works differently for you*.

2. The scene where Carson Welles meets Lleweyln Moss in the hospital in Mexico. Carson is talking about Chigurh, and Llewelyn makes the comments ""Who is this guy? The ultimate badass?"" in kind of an annoyed tone of voice.

The three main protagonists of the movie, Llewelyn, Ed Bell, and Chigurh, all share the same flaw to varying degrees--they all share in a degree of personal exceptionalism:

1. Ed Bell believes at some level that he's on a noble path, and like he tells his brother, he felt like his choices would be validated in the end by ""God suddenly coming into my life""--feeling like his life would culminate in some spiritual satisfaction and was therefore meant to be. He has become disillusioned by the lack of this feeling--a lack of success or victory as a lawman (as he sees it), with the criminals getting away with heinous, senseless violence. He can't even find closure in his personal life--the dream he describes to his wife in the end symbolizes that: it doesn't have a happy, meaningful ending--it just ends.

2. Llewlyn thinks *he* is the ultimate badass and that he's smart/tough enough to overcome any adversary, even if it's the full brunt of the drug cartel. He tries to act like he's Rambo by putting all of his Vietnam combat experience into staging his escape/cat-and-mouse hunt with Chigurh, and his ego won't let him give up the fight. Carla Jean is enamored by this quality when she tries to tell Ed Bell that Llewelyn can take on all comers. In actuality, we see, as Carson points out, that he's a loser who can't make ends meet and is really not that difficult to predict. The movie devotes a fair number of scenes to him ""prepping"" for the fight by buying various things from sporting goods stores, and as a moviegoer you expect some kind of Rambo/A-Team/MacGyver-esque ingenuity from that, but it doesn't really amount to much. His skills and instincts keep him alive for a while, but he never really turns the tables and is vastly outnumbered by the cartel, which has no dearth of hitmen after him.

3. Chigurh, of course, is delusional and insane and believes he is some sort of supernatural force of fate.

All three guys commit the sin of vanity in their own ways, and Reality ensues for them all, but the only one to cash his chips in and move on with life is Bell. He is humbled by the carnage and literally escapes with his life after he decides to give up his pursuit (with Chigurh right there!). That's the movie for me--it's an all-time great movie that still has me thinking about it nearly twenty years later.",805,145,1751867475.0,Discussion,0.9,True,False,wordsandwich,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ltmf6a/i_think_i_finally_understand_no_country_for_old/,new,medium
movies,1ltly43,"The ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl Trope"" is NOT sexist and wildly overhated.","I know. I am a straight white man and I do not understand the experiences and nuance of being woman no matter how progressive and empathetic I try to appear for others who have faced discrimination. BUT as someone who has recently come across this idea of the MPDG in media, I find this critique of relationship to be incredibly overblown.

For those who do not know, a MPDG is a trope in media where a woman, usually eccentric and wild, enters some sort of relationship with a man who defies the conventional ""alpha male"" trope that is usually depicted in romances. Some of the most popular examples are Summer (500 Days of Summer) and Sam (The Perks of Being a Wallflower) and Ramona (Scott Pilgrim).

My issue with the argument that it is sexist comes from 2 very important points:

1. Media exists in a different frame than reality. The entire point of media is to fulfill the imagination of our minds that stray away from reality. We do not watch television for the mundane expected things in our lives, but for things that shock us or provide some sort of stimulation (fear, anger, horniness, heartache). The unrealistic love interests extend to all different types of characters and so if the story is about one specific character and another is used as a prop to explore their arc and the way they interact in the world... than it honestly is not that big of a deal.

2. The Double-Standard between genders. As someone who watches a lot of KDramas, one of the biggest tropes I see if the hot, rich, ripped businessman with all good values be used as a way to bring out the ""country poor girl"" out of her shell and introduce her into the world. No one bats an eye and points out how offensive it is for an entire man's pirpose is to explore the archetype of the woman. It is the same thing. And I do not care because I know it to be media. Those ""perfect men"" do not exist in the real world... just as the MPDGs do not. It is all in the head of the person who is at the center of the film.

But what do you think? Am I actually being sexist and just not cognizant of it? Or does my opinion hold some merit?",0,79,1751865742.0,Media,0.2,True,False,Over-Heron-2654,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ltly43/the_manic_pixie_dream_girl_trope_is_not_sexist/,new,low

movies,1lth6fa,RRR (2022),"RRR is a 2022 Telugu-language Indian movie that’s over three hours long. It's a period, action, drama, comedy, musical, epic story. 

The story follows two men, Raju and Bheem. They are in 1920s India during the British Empire’s rule. Raju is an undercover cop, he is performing an investigation to find a man. He doesn’t know what this man looks like, all he knows is that he will be in hiding, not using his real name; in a sense, the man whom he is looking for will also be undercover. 

While performing this search, Raju meets Bheem and they become best friends. Well, it turns out that Bheem is the person that Raju is looking for, but during their friendship, he doesn’t realize it. It’s as if in The Departed, the Matt and Leo characters became best friends. The story continues from there, and gets even wilder.

If you haven’t seen this film, go watch it. It is a thrill ride to say the least. The action is over the top in the best possible way. The story of friendship between Raju and Bheem is one of the best bromances ever put to screen. The way they meet is one of the craziest action set pieces I’ve ever seen. It involves one riding a horse, the other riding a motorcycle, both jumping off a bridge, and there’s  an exploding train. The music is fantastic. At one point, while our characters are at a somewhat snobby English party, there is a dance-off that is quite ridiculous, but by that point in the film, you are so into the story that it doesn’t matter. It’s not the sort of thing most American audiences would get into, but trust me, you should let yourself experience it.

Now I’m going to spoil some of the film. There are some twists/reveals that happen, and I want to be able to discuss some aspects of the film that will give them away, so if you haven’t seen RRR, stop reading here if you don’t want the story spoiled.

What I want to get into first is Raju and what his real background is. The idea up until the reveal is that this whole time, he has just been an undercover cop. This works as a story, but, even as handsome and charming as Raju is, the character is a terrible person. He is Indian, but all we have seen from him is an extreme desire to be a good soldier for the British Empire and do whatever he must in order to gain promotion within the military ranks. Once we finally get to the flashback scene where we see Raju as a child, we see that has actually gone undercover as a civilian while being a civilian who is undercover as a cop - yeah, I know, hard to do the mental gymnastics, but trust me, in the movie, it’s quite clear. Now, after we get to know his true story, I don’t hate him so much. His whole goal has been to bring guns to his people so that they could have a better chance of fighting back the British. But, I still don’t like what he’s done in order to achieve his goal. He has hurt his own people in order to help the greater Indian population.

The choice to show this flashback before the scene where Raju publicly whips Bheem makes that flogging even more powerful. Raju is whipping his best friend, and a friend he is actually on the same side as, but he still can’t let the British know that. Bheem refuses to neel, and through the power of music, turns the public whipping from a tactic of the British to control through fear, into a way of rallying the Indian people together against the oppressive English government. Meanwhile, Raju has to do so much evil to the ones he sides with in order to achieve his goals. At this point I’m also reminded of the man he tortures whilst looking for Bheem, as well as all the people he hurt in his introduction scene where he fights an entire mob.

Luckily, we have another character to compare with Raju. Bheem’s goal is much simpler. All he wants is to rescue his little sister, Malli, from the English woman who kidnapped her. Once Bheem finds Malli, he only hurts people on the enemy side. He never hurts anyone on the same side as him. Once he learns Raju’s truth, he goes to rescue his friend. The action of the rescue is goofy as hell, but fantastic all the same. 

Actually, that sums up much of the movie, “goofy as hell, but fantastic all the same.” It’s fantastic in how over the top the action is.  There is literally a dance-off. One character breaks into song while being whipped in public. The love between Bheem and Raju is genuine. The way the actor’s use their expressive eyes is top work. Like most Americans, I’m usually a little bit averse to watching foreign movies, but trust me, RRR is worth it.",0,7,1751850173.0,Review,0.41,True,False,antantantantantant,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lth6fa/rrr_2022/,new,low

Some of these countries will be tough to get answers for but we will do our best. Just like u/Impossible_Werewolf I will be operating this alphabetically per continent. I will be including a select few landmasses that are widely recognized as separate countries depending on which government you ask. This includes but not limited to: Taiwan, Palestine, Western Sahara, and Greenland. However, to make things easier, I won't be including all existing territories, especially little island ones.

 The order of continents will be:

1. Asia

2. Oceania

3. Africa

4. South America

5. North America

I) It's not important if the movie was made in the given country, but it *has* to be set there (e.g. the movie can be set in Paris, but hasn't to be a french movie after all). Though let's always try to prioritize movies with the native language, if possible. If a movie is split between a few locations I’m looking for where it’s rooted. 

II) After 24 hours, whatever movie comment gets the most upvotes, wins. make sure that the film is not already mentioned before creating a new comment. **Please! I don’t wanna go through reading a bunch of the same movie.**

movies,1ltgnjg,Most distracting use of sound effects you've ever heard in a movie?,"I used to do SFX and my first job out of university was a shock to me because I realized motorbikes and gunshots on screen didn't sound like actual motorbikes or gunshots. I suddenly realized the studio's collection of 100 000 sound effects was useless without the experience to know which 50 effects the audience had been conditioned to accept as authentic by other films. And then there as the foleying that I helped with, in which a man kneeing a watermelon doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, a real punch to the face doesn't sound like a Hollywood effect, but a man kneeing a watermelon with olive oil on his leg sounded ""right"" for reasons I can't explain.

Something I appreciate in the filming of movies is when the actors are actually shouting in loud environments (nightclubs, windstorms) because they're recorded in silence and the music/wind is added later. What this usually results in is the audio being loud to establish it's loud, then the SFX editor has to radically drop the levels because the actors have been recorded talking in their normal voices. I appreciate it when the director gives them directions to act like they're in a loud place. I was on a set once where the director had the actors put earplugs in so they HAD to yell (everyone in the scene had long hair or were given weird hats to hide the ear plugs).

Anyways, I'm watching Bullet Train Explosion right now and they just used the Wilhelm scream for a student getting punched. I had to burst out laughing because, well, it sounds right when someone falls off a cliff, not when someone falls over a train seat.

Since Mad Max Fury Road, Big budget filmmaking seems to have hit an action plateau.","Look at the Mission Impossible franchise. 400 million for the lastest film yet not a single sequence comes close to matching the franchises action apex. The first films train Chunnel sequence or the Burj Khalifa climb in MI4. 


I hate to turn this into a “back in the day” thing but when cgi was advancing year after year in the early 90s-2010s it really felt like action cinema has being topped every couple years along with it. Studios would pour millions into R&D to create a sequence or sequences such as Spiderman fighting Doc Ock or Neo fighting dozens of Agent Smiths or Anakin Skywalker Podracing, twisters demolishing a town or LOTR with Aargorn defending helms deep, the Rohirrim charge & Mines of Moria. These sequences would be planned and detailed so that visual effects companies knew what could or couldn’t be done with the tech available.

It was as if break thrus were created just to have these sorts of sequences. And I’m not saying action sucks today’s or it’s bad. No. It just seems like there isn’t that focused “set piece” style of filmmaking. Like the car chase in Matrix Reloaded. Or Davey Jones sending the Kraken after Jack Sparrow. Or T-Rex terrorizing a couple kids and eating a lawyer.

Audiences were seeing things we had never seen before. Transformers fighting in a city? Awesome. But over time? Superhero’s battling gets stale. Thousands of computer generated armies clashing gets stale.

Meanwhile I think of Nomadland. Other than the main character's background of losing her things in a recession, the story isn't supposed to be sad.

movies,1ltf24b,Why doesn't the PG rating mean anything anymore?,"This is a question that I've wanted to know the true answer to for a long time. Because we rarely get G-rated movies nowadays. If they do, they're usually not mainstream. 

The PG rating used to mean something, but now they're stigmatized as being ""kids only"" movies the same way the G rating was 20 years ago. Despite the stigma, that didn't stop The Lion King, Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, or Wall-E to be successful & universally beloved despite all being rated G. For years, Disney & Pixar produced nothing but G-rated material. But then, the success of Shrek proved that it's acceptable for movies marketed towards kids to have swearing & sex jokes to appeal to older audiences, and therfore obtain a PG rating.

There are several movies from the 70s & 80s that were rated PG but would be PG-13 now. Several examples include Jaws, Star Wars, Airplane, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Beetlejuice, Gremlins, etc. In fact the PG-13 rating was created because the MPAA didn't know where to place Temple of Doom. The downside is that gory movies like these is all that Hollywood wanted to make for years.

But then PG movie is now try to be as inoffensive, safe, and sanitized as possible. The give every kids' movie this rating despite not doing anything to justify it. For instance, would parents even bother watching movies like Despicable Me, Frozen, Trolls, or Encanto with their kids? Not really.

But we're entering the era where PG movies are starting to take risks & actually earn there ratings. A few examples on the live action front are Conclave, Wicked, and the Sonic movies. And there are many PG-rated animated movies that I can name that justify their ratings as well (both old & new):

movies,1ltepi5,Bad/mediocre movies with great performances hidden in them?,"Movies that were absolute, total stinkers, or even painfully average, but had great performances they didn’t deserve. 

One that comes to mind is Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. These movies have a lot of problems, even though I enjoy them, but Ewan McGregor’s performance is the one of the things that is consistently good through all 3 movies. He brings a level of emotional depth and nuance to the character the script and direction doesn’t even call for. It’s a testament to how poor the direction is when there are so many other great actors who give awful, wooden performances in those films. Liam Neeson, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid all rise above the shitty script and direction as well, bringing life to their characters and chewing the scenery. 

Another film is X Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman gave his best performance as the title character up to that point, and it was completely wasted on the steaming pile of dogshit that was that movie. Liev Schreiber was also excellent in that film, bringing a charisma to Sabretooth that a less skilled actor would have lacked. 

Michael Fassbender in Prometheus comes to mind as well

movies,1ltbwkz,"I  hadn't heard of ""Riff Raff"" until I saw it advertised on Hulu. Do yourself a favor and watch it tonight if you haven't already.","It's not the best crime film ever made by any stretch, and parts are a little bit predictable, but the cast is stellar and there are a few fun surprises.

Notably, Pete Davidson is pretty fucking great in his role. Normally when one sees Davidson in a film, he's playing a version of himself, but not in *Riff Raff*. Instead he plays the role a little quieter (comparatively) and more seriously, even though the character is kind of stupid. It makes for a great turn for the guy.

Bill Murray plays a total asshole, but this is the first time I've seen Murray really try acting in awhile, and he pulls it off. He doesn't even steal all of the scenes he's in for a change.

Gabrielle Union is great as always, but I do wish her character had been given more to do than be the concerned-and-then-worried wife.

Ed Harris is getting grizzled, and it's in a good way. Here he is a former gangster whose past is catching up to him, and he's just over it. And it's great.

Then there is the great Jennifer Coolidge who is having a renaissance of sorts. I am convinced there is nobody in Hollywood having more fun than her right now and it's great to see. 

And rounding things out is Lewis Pullman, son of Bill, who will also be starring in the new *Spaceballs* film because he has the exact same manner of charm as his dad, and it's great to see.

The film itself is a tad formulaic as far as this kind of film goes, sure. But the acting from everyone is great, and there are some really well-out-together scenes, notably the sequence in which Murray and Davidson's characters go to Vincent's house in search of him to kill him and his son (Pullman) only to be greeted by neighbors who bring them cookies.

The ending ends like four times, which hearkens back to the post-Pulp Fiction crime film explosion of the mid-90s, but it can be forgiven.

movies,1ltbkbb,It feels like very few animated movies nowadays actually feel like they earned the PG rating,"Remember that the original meaning of the PG rating means Parent Guidance and before PG-13 was introduced that's what a lot of movies fall into and nowadays the PG rating feels like a replacement for the G rating even though that its original intended meaning mint some things were in there for older audiences

And many animated movies nowadays feel like they absolutely do not deserve the PG rating and should be rated G instead

and remember the PG rating does not mean kid friendly and in a lot of older PG movies there was a lot of stuff that aren't going to be suitable for kids nowadays

and though there were still some exceptions like Hunchback of Notre Dame being rated G despite having a song where the main villain sings about his lust and hellfire for a woman and blaming him for him sining but that just so happens to be the exception not the rule

and very few animated movies from the past 25 years actually felt that they deserved the PG rating

and also there are some movies that absolutely do not deserve the PG rating at all like the second Paw Patrol movie being the same age rating as Watership Down is definitely wrong like WTF!?

And most modern Disney and Pixar movies don't feel like they've earned its PG rating at all especially Frozen and the first zootopia movie

I remember when PG movies actually require ""parent guidance"" instead of being G-rated movies pretending to be PG

and also a lot of DreamWorks movies actually deserve their PG rating but there are still some I feel like don't deserve it like the trolls franchise and every single one of illuminations movies don't deserve that PG rating at all and should be rated G

over the past 25 years there are very few animated movies that actually earned its PG rating actually requiring parent guidance instead of it being a G-rated movie in disguise

but it seems like we're now entering the era of PG movies that actually earned their rating

we're starting to see more and more PG movies actually pushing the boundaries and actually acquiring parents guidance like the old PG movies before the PG-13 rating was introduced

Like Conclave and Wicked being successes

and it seems like animated movies are starting to go in this direction as well

and we're going to see more animated movies head in this direction as well

like we already saw with Transformers One has a lot of violence non mild swearing like ""Hell"" and ""Ass"" and it's deep political messages that might not be suitable for young audiences so it would actually require ""parent guidance"" and thus Transformers One is much closer to PG movies back then actually getting away with a lot more stuff than PG movies now

and the Spider Verse films are much closer to older PG movies and tones then than modern ones

and it seems like from what I heard from the rumors, zootopia 2 is going to be a lot darker and more mature than the previous film, with the main villain actually murdering several characters

and here are some other PG animated movies that earned their rating

-Kpop Demon Hunters

-Coraline

-The Mitchells vs. the Machines

-Wreck-It Ralph

-Kubo and the Two Strings

-Shrek

-The Incredibles

-The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists

and it seems good that we're going into the direction where PG films do not always mean kid-friendly being G-rated films in disguise

movies,1lt7h7p,“The Alto Knights” Isn’t Bad,"First I rented it, and Spectrum did something weird to the picture (the same thing happened when I rented “Sinners”).  It looked like it was shot at 60 frames per second or something.  A few people on here said I might have accidentally turned on “motion smoothing,” but that wasn’t the case.  Regardless, I couldn’t focus on the actual movie because the picture was so distracting.

Then I upgraded to HBO, and was able to watch it in standard format.

It’s not bad.

It could’ve been cast better.  For example, Michael Rispoli and Katherine Narcucci played supporting roles.

There’s also some other campy stuff in there that was just unnecessary.  

But I think the biggest problem it has is that it doesn’t hold up to the classics of the genre.  That’s why the reception was so lukewarm — because any time you watch a mob movie, you’re comparing it to “The Godfather,” “Goodfellas,” “Casino,” etc.  But a movie can be decent without it being a classic, and “The Alto Knights” fits that description.  It’s pretty good.  The best movie about the Italian-American mob since “Donnie Brasco,” highlighted by a throwback performance from De Niro.

movies,1lt7ays,I didn't know how bad I was aching for a chick flick until Kpop Demon Hunters (2025) satisfied that desire out of nowhere. What a kick ass movie from every angle.,"This is just a spoiler free recommendation

First and foremost, I don't like Kpop. Don't really listen to it. Not a pop person in general. Just listen to a few hits here or there, I'm saying this to highlight I'm not the targeted demographic for this flick. But despite that the premise of this movie, popstars Vs. Demons seemed really intresting to me. So I went in with doubts and walked out with my mind blown. This was one of the best things that came out this year and as far as animation goes, one of the best animated things I've seen in a long while.

That biggest thing that has floored me about this movie is just the sheer amount of outfits the characters change into. They fucking went HAM on their character designs. The animation quality and the exquisite taste of this movie are top notch. Smooth Sakuga action scenes at every corner.

I can't praise this movie enough. It's perfect from every angle. It's bursting with Korean culture and It's fucking hilarious, the comedy is spot on. It's taking aspects from K-movies, dramas, music, fashion. Everthing. The story is also fucking amazing when it hits it's emotional peaks.

The biggest compliment I can give this movie is that it's like capturing those imaginary music videos we make in our heads when listening to music and animating it into an hour and a half montage.

The songs in this movie have potential to be ""Let It Go"" annoying with the overuse. Because they're catchy af.

I didn't know how bad I was aching for a good ~~chick flick~~ (**EDIT**: ***Not*** a chick flick, my bad. I misinterpreted the term. I meant girl power action movie) until this satisfied that desire spontaneously. It brought back a sense of nostalgia for me of watching Totally Spies for some reason.

movies,1lt70c8,Isn’t it wild how something so small can live inside you forever,"There’s this one scene from The Choice that’s etched into me. I must’ve watched it when I was 18 I guess, too young to understand the full weight of love and loss. But now I’m 29 and I still think about that scene almost every single day. And I honestly have no idea why.

It’s the part where Travis builds this little gazebo on the island the one where he and his wife Gabby had shared quiet moments before life got loud. After everything the accident, the heartbreak, the waiting he creates this simple, quiet space. Replaces the wind chimes. Waits with this kind of hope that love would find its way back. And somehow she comes back. Just a man building a place for love to come home to. And she does. 

 I don’t know why that scene found a home inside me. Why over a decade later it still lingers. I think about that scene more often than I realize. Not because it’s overly dramatic or romantic in a predictable way but because something about it feels… familiar. The idea of building something with your own hands, out of love, out of waiting, out of pure, aching belief. Maybe it’s the metaphor I keep returning to. The hope. The stillness. The quiet, unwavering kind of love that doesn’t chase, it builds. And waits.

Tho still not sure why it haunts me gently the way it does, Sometimes I think we’re all carrying a little island inside us. A place where we hang our own wind chimes. A place where we wait not out of desperation, but out of love. Out of belief. Out of something softer than logic but stronger than time.

Isn’t it wild how one quiet scene can take root in your heart and never leave?

movies,1lt2z26,Watching Capone (2020) felt like watching a feature-length version of one of those fake movies they make for real movies....Anyone else feel that way?,"
Weather playing on a TV in a room or showing at a movie theater or even taking a larger role within the actual movie. This felt like a prestige drama that belongs within a satire, where a well-known actor is playing a totally deranged role and everyone in-universe is pretending it’s Oscar-worthy. That’s the exact energy Capone gives off.

It didn’t hit me at first. I started off just kind of baffled, then hit the infamous diarrhea scenes—and that’s when I mentally broke. Not in a “this is bad” way, but in a “wait... this isn’t a real movie, this is a parody of a movie within a movie” kind of way.

After that, I couldn’t unsee it. Tom Hardy isn’t playing Al Capone—he’s playing the role that some fictional actor takes on in a movie about Hollywood excess. You can just feel the scene where the camera pans behind the scenes and he’s like, totally serious about the role and the praise is pouring in. 

Once I saw it that way, I weirdly started to appreciate it. I’d never watch it again, but it’s kind of brilliant as a fake movie that accidentally became real. Like an accidental Tropic Thunder moment, just played completely straight.

movies,1lsw2ai,John Carpenter's Memoirs of an Invisible Man starring Chevy Chase... what a strange movie. What went wrong? And who could have been a better lead?,"*Memoirs of an Invisible Man* is such an odd film. There *are* some things that work and it looks great visually (no shock with John Carpenter directing). But tonally, it's a mess.

Chevy Chase seems totally miscast. This was that era where he usually looked like he sleepwalks through roles unless it was a *Vacation* movie. He switches between his usual comedy persona and this weirdly bland, serious version of himself.

His narration is so overwrought too, like it's trying really hard to sell drama but failing miserably.

The character is kind of an idiot. Keeps making mistake after mistake. 

There’s one scene that actually made me laugh... when he knocks out a drunk guy to steal his cab. That moment felt like the *real* Chevy Chase. But the rest of the movie plays it so straight it’s almost uncomfortable.

It’s like Chase was trying to make a comedy while Carpenter was directing a straight-up paranoid thriller.

It reminded me of the behind-the-scenes tension on *Vampire in Brooklyn:* Eddie Murphy wanted to be serious, Wes Craven wanted to make it horror comedy, and neither tone won.

I wouldn’t be surprised if *Memoirs* had a bunch of reshoots or rewrites. It definitely feels like it didn’t know what it wanted to be.

Honestly, I think another actor, someone younger and more energetic could have made it work better and played more in sync with Carpenter.

movies,1lsvnwf,Black Swan diagnosis discussion,"I just want to start this off by saying I’m not an expert in the slightest. I’m here because I’m curious and not to spread hate or misinformation and I certainly don’t want to offend anyone. So if I say something wrong please call me out so I know.

I just watched black swan for the first time and I FREAKING LOVED IT. But I’m curious if there is a definite answer of what mental issues Nina is struggling with. I’ve recently watched some videos in which DID was thoroughly explained and I thought that’s what it was. I mean at some point Lily is made Nina’s “alternate” which from my understanding is what the personalities of someone with DID are called. And also I learned that alternates are commonly created as a result of trauma. So when Nina is talking to Thomas and says “You made her my alternate”, I thought that was a double meaning where the stress of changing for the role caused her to have this new alternate.

I also considered that she had schizophrenia as well because I wasn’t sure if most people with DID have alternates based off of real people. So like she has this alternate that she sees and talks to because of her DID, but the schizophrenia also makes her hallucinate that the alternate is Lily.

But again this is just what I thought when I was watching it and I’d love to know what others thought or if there are any absolute answers from psychologists.

Shaun of the Dead 🔴,Hot Fuzz 🔵,and Worlds End 🟢 are all part of the Cornetto trilogy that are all connected by Cornetto.

I enjoy this trilogy especially since Edgar Wright took inspiration from the Color Trilogy which I need to rewatch again because they’re fantastic films. All 3 films have their moments and it’s just so hard to find a favorite yet I know which one is the best.

Worlds End is the best one from the trilogy for simply being the most compelling and maturing quality of the film where everything comes together so hands down Worlds End is the best one yet Shaun of the End or Hot Fuzz are competing for my favorite spot because one is a modernized version of a zombie film in Shaun and a satire yet action filled cop film in Hot Fuzz.

movies,1lso72l,Recommendations for Robot Movies?,"I've been doing a self-imposed challenge this year. Every Monday, I watch a different Nicolas Cage film. I'm halfway through the year now, and I'm loving it! Forcing myself to watch a thing I otherwise might not ever touch has forced me out of my normal film taste, and having such a defined structure has been a way to keep myself going through it.

With that said, I want to do it again in 2026 with a new theme. Nicolas Cage has been a great subject, but has some limitations. A lot of his work can be pretty samey, and basically everything is feature-length. Sometimes finding an entire 90 minutes on a Monday is super difficult, and I want to give myself some leeway.

So I'm trying to do robots next year. Anything robots. I thought asking people here would be better than just googling and making a list on my own. All recommendations will go into a list on Letterboxd for myself so I can pick through it through the year.

Requirements:

⚪ The movie has to have a robot in it. It doesn't have to be a starring role. It can even just be one scene. But preferably, the robot would have some significance to the themes of the film.

⚪ A robot can be a lot of different things, but it needs to have some sense of humanity. Blade Runner counts. Transformers counts. Even Interstellar counts. Sonic the Hedgehog (with the little drone robots) doesn't count.

⚪ Short films and documentaries are a plus, to space out normal feature films.

⚪ Bad movies are awesome! Like I said, I'm watching Nic Cage movies this year. My tolerance for bad movies is pretty high.

⚪ It needs to have a Letterboxd entry. Sorry, that's just how I track my movie habits. If it's not on Letterboxd, I may still watch it, but it won't be part of this.

movies,1lso00g,In defense of Rotten Tomatoes,"Rotten Tomatoes gets clowned on a lot. And I somewhat get it. Because a 90% doesn’t mean critics on average give it a 9/10, just that 90% of critics liked it well enough to give it a positive recommendation. 

Now there are exceptions, but for me that binary system actually works really well for me determining if I’m going to enjoy a film or not. It’s not a predictor of the degree to which I’ll enjoy a film, but it’s a powerful predictor as to the likelihood I’ll enjoy a movie.

Like I’ll see basically anything with 90+% score and be guaranteed I’ll basically like it, even if the film wasn’t on my radar. It’s also a good guarantee that my friends and/or dates will like it, because ultimately the tomato score is an arbiter of broad appeal. 

Ironically my favorite films tend to have a slightly lower RT film, just because usually to become a favorite, it has to do something really distinctive and have a strong POV from the film maker, which usually means it’s a bit more divisive. But those usually end up at arthouse theaters and I let those theaters generally curate for me.

Star Wars: How people in the Original Trilogy seem to think the Jedi were just a myth, even though they existed for thousands of years prior, and weren't wiped out until 20 years before, meaning there would be plenty of people still alive who had interacted with them. I've heard people suggest the Empire did a 1984-esque campaign to make people forget, but I'm just not buying it. It would be like if some evil dictator wiped out all Hindus, and 20 years later most people thought Hindus never existed, even though there would undoubtedly be people who had Hindu friends and acquaintances still around.

movies,1lskla4,What are some other big budget but experimental films?,"TL;Dr - what major releases or big-budget films essentially are experimental films in disguise? 

----

I went to school in Boulder, and I was lucky enough to do a little film School under Bruce Kawin, but the real point is that I sold Stan Brakhage cigarettes at Jones drug on the hill and I got to talk to him a lot. It was really rewarding, and it gave me a fascinating insight to experimental filmmaking that I hadn't considered prior to meeting him or having a little film theory injected into my brain.

So I'm obviously not talking about moth light or really niche experimental filmmaking. But rather, what are some big budget films that essentially act like Blockbusters or big releases that are truly doing something experimental?

Namely, Interstellar with the sound design, or Warfare by Alex Garland as an experiment in memory versus objective reality. I am endlessly fascinated by the latter film. 

Alex Garland worked with a Marine to present what essentially is a nonfiction autobiographical retelling of a short battle in Iraq. So Warfare is a study in the malleability of memory in context of talking to all the Marines and trying to piece together the literal nonfiction objective reality account, and they still ran into impossibly complex contradictions where you could objectively know they misremembered things. It's a fascinating experiment in filmmaking. It is neither a rah rah pro-America pro-War film nor is it a anti War film. It's almost like Michael Heneke, forcing the audience to do the work themselves. Any objective observer would easily review the nonfiction account and arrive at their own conclusion.

So what are other major or large or big budget releases that were essentially experimental in nature in some manner or regard?",4,18,1751750838.0,Discussion,0.6,True,False,unclefishbits,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lskla4/what_are_some_other_big_budget_but_experimental/,new,low

\- No duds or bad performances.

\- Little to no controversy surrounding him.

\- Was sometimes mocked for understated performances like Drive early in his career but that seems to have faded with a wide range of performances.

Leo - Wins on resume and range but not popular with women who can't stand his dating preferences. 

Pitt - Also wins on resume, has similar range, more controversial reputation.

Cruise - Biggest movie star for a long time, has the most hits but a long list of controversial lifestyle choices.

Reeves - Possibly most beloved movie star on the internet but questionable range.

Reynolds - Maybe held the crown for a brief time but became oversaturated and doesn't have much range.

movies,1lsfvgt,Why I think Brad Pitt is a cooler / better star than Tom Cruise?,"Below views are my opinion, no offense to anyone.

I'm not saying this just after watching F1 - it's something I've always felt and F1 just reinforced that idea.

  
**Tom Cruise** \- Always has this 'I know I am amazing' kind of egoistic-proud look on his face at all times - I mean even on-screen over the past few (7-8) years including recent MI movies. 

Sure, he may have had that 'innocence' in his younger days in films like Vanilla Sky, Minority Report etc.But not these days. The ego, the fame has gotten to his head but more importantly it SHOWS on his face and persona. Same thing with DiCaprio.

  
But here's where our man is different:

**Brad Pitt** \- From a film back in the day like 7 years in Tibet - till today in OUATIH or F1, Pitt's face still has a certain 'vulnerability' - it doesn't scream 'yo I'm a rich superstar and know everything' , there's a certain 'I've gone through a lot of struggle to get here and there's a lot  beneath this cool exterior and swag' kinda thing about him.

That's why when he plays roles like F1 where 'he was once a successful dude who lost everything and is now having a second chance to prove himself' - we feel that emotion and root for him as his eyes, his wrinkles convey a certain level of that 'pain'.

And most of the world isn't rich - most of the world are people 'trying' to succeeed and get better and have many struggles to deal with. So a story + actor/role that embodies that feeling is always likely to hit home!

movies,1lse8uf,"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) is one those films that while influential, bears little resemblance to the movies it inspired.","The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (sic) was shot in a month during a heat-wave on a budget of nothing. For a grindhouse horror film there isn't that much visible blood, nor is there any nudity. The director Tobe Hooper was honestly banking on the film earning a PG rating at the time. It got an R, but also made turned a profit thirty times over. The cast was made up of locals, and it was filmed around three buildings, a graveyard, and inside a van.

Massacre is one of those interesting films because, while it inspired later slasher films, the movie itself had no rulebook to follow. The plot and script is thin, more a disturbing trip than anything. There are five main characters and I couldn't tell you their names except for the annoying guy in a wheelchair, Franklin. Apparently his actor stayed in character between filming, which pissed off the rest of the cast and crew. It may reflect badly on me finding it a relief when Leatherface carves a defenceless man in wheelchair like a Christmas turkey, but I'll take what I'm given.

Four of the five leads are killed in quick succession in the middle act, having no idea they're in a horror-movie until it's too late. We don't know them too well, and they don't fit any archetypes. They're not characters, more just random people. Aside from an encounter with a creepy hitchhiker and a spot of grave-robbing I was surprised at how normal the first act of the movie is compared the depravity of the last.

When I saw the excellent **Sinners** there was only scene I thought was superfluous and that's the first one. It's a flash-forward depicting one of the survivors after the main event and we briefly get a glimpse of the vampires. This felt like a pointless concession as the actual first scene properly establishes the same character, while the vampires don't appear until the first act is over, a la **From Dusk til Dawn**.

Here, Leatherface is interesting as a villain because he comes absolutely out of nowhere. There's no scare chord, no POV shot of him at his work, no prior hint to his existence. Thirty-five minutes into the movie a guy walks into a country house in the afternoon, and then he's bludgeoned to death by a giant butcher wearing a flayed face as a mask.

Leatherface isn't the sole villain either. Instead he's just the pitiable son or brother in a family of cannibals, incapable of communicating normally. None of the villains are named, nor are they invincible. One of them gets run over in the street, and Leatherface gets belted in the face with a wrench. I find it  interesting when antagonists in horror movies experience their own setbacks. Unless they're a zombie or explicitly supernatural, they should suffer the occasional pratfall. While the family may bicker and act camp, the film itself never wavers from its gritty and bleak tone.

There's a lot of aspects to the film's production that obviously shouldn't be replicated. They used a live chainsaw which almost killed Leatherface's actor on more than one occasion. The leading lady was thrown out a window and had her finger cut and sucked by another actor. The crew also spent entire days filming the dining-room scene, having to contend with the heatwave and long-spoiled food. Pretty much nobody had to act in the deranged climax

Massacre is an 80 minute-film about a gang of hapless young adults getting carved up by cannibals. Where it a better movie it'd be considerably worse. Had the camerawork been more elaborate, the acting more professional, and the special-effects like the old-man mask been of higher quality, the results would have been less interesting. You need a considerable budget if you're depicting a shapeshifting alien in the Antarctic, or having a housefly transform into Jeff Goldblum. But for a minor bloodbath in Texas the raw and unpolished feel is the film's best aspect. The director's own sequel was a black comedy, while every other follow-up just kind of existed. The last one made jabs at millennials for some reason.

While it may not be worth trying to recapture the lightning in a bottle, given how many of the sequels flopped, I think the method of Massacre is still fertile for horror. By shooting the horror like a straight documentary instead of a lavish Hollywood film, you make the viewer feel like an uncomfortable witness instead of a safe audience. The horror can happen in the middle of the day with zero warning in a local neighbourhood. The soundtrack can be either absent or come across as utterly maumed, and maybe pay John Larroquette in weed to do the opening narration again.",15,12,1751734009.0,Discussion,0.67,True,False,DeadRobotsSociety,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lse8uf/the_texas_chain_saw_massacre_1974_is_one_those/,new,low
movies,1lsdoni,In defense of Rebel Moon,"I've just finished the two directors' cut versions of the rebel moon movies and, with a few exceptions, really loved them. I haven't seen the previous versions. For the record I don't give a shit about Zack Snyder, I never really liked any of these movies, even his first ones.



I'll take a scene at the beginning of the second film to explain why I really liked them, I'll keep it vague so as not to spoil it. In the first third of Rebel Moon part 2, there's a surprise assassination scene on a ship. Some people arrive, thinking they're inaugurating the ship, and everyone gets killed. A string quartet in the corner accompanies the scene, surprisingly adapting what they're playing to what's happening in front of them. The whole thing is, of course, full of slow motion and superfluous effect. And I loved this scene as much as I loved the film, because Snyder and the people around him weren't afraid to be absolutely grandiloquent and ridiculous, taking themselves very seriously to make something epic, in the literal sense of the word, something with big feelings, melodrama, very nasty villains and ultra-heroic heroes. And with the prevalence of Marvelization of films (compare Old Guard to its sequel, for example) where everything is a joke and nothing is to be taken seriously, well, it's good to see something where they’re not afraid of being ridiculous. It's absolutely dramatic in the best sense of the word, and it's good to see that kind of thing. 



I even liked the harvest scene, it was beautiful.



So yes, I know symbolism is the most in-your-face symbolism in the world, the action scenes are based on the rule of cool rather than common sense (thank you General Titus for your strategy of making a bunch of peasants run screaming rather than hiding in buildings to snipe at the bad guys), and the visual effects are so present that some scenes are 50% random fireflies, but that's it, it's a pleasure to see, the actors are all beautiful, the robot Jimmy has an incredible design and it's Anthony Hopkins who tells poetry, it's the kind of work that also makes me have big emotions.



Yes, it's very cheesy and grandiloquent, yes there's a lot of slow motion and everything is enormously produced, but we're entitled to say that it's cool and that sometimes it's good when things are cool. Slow motion isn't bad in itself, and here it's used to create tableaux, to say “look how classy this thing is”, and while I understand that some may find it tiresome, I got a real kick out of it. Yes, it's not Macbeth, but it's grandiose and I found that enjoyable. Rebel Moon is the 7 Samurai in the Warhammer 40k universe, with fireflies everywhere. 



I really hope to have more of it, I want to keep experiencing this universe.

movies,1lsdcbt,Any fans of Promising Young Woman (2020)? A damn good dark comedy with a hell of an ending,"Just watched Emerald Fennell's Promising Young Woman and loved it. I saw a lot of polarizing reviews of it on Reddit but honestly I really vibed with it. It's a revenge drama that goes out of its way to make the act of getting vengeance completely emotionally draining and traumatizing. Weaved into the narrative is a fair bit of important social commentary on rape culture and sexual assault.

Carey Mulligan gives an absolutely fantastic performance, simultaneously funny, charming, badass, broken, traumatized and vulnerable. The casting in general is on-point, especially the movie's conscious decision to use well-known ""good guys"" to play rapists and rape enablers. 

The climax of the movie is an absolute gut-punch and I can see why so many people hated it. It takes some major balls to kill off your righteous, justice-seeking protagonist in such a brutal, agonizing manner, by the de-facto villain of the story of all people. But it makes sense with the thematic intent of the movie, which is the old adage of digging 2 graves when seeking revenge. The actual ending of the movie does somewhat lessen the blow a little bit but it feels very much like a pyrrhic victory.

movies,1ls6zmf,Did somebody watched this polish horror movie?,"The movie name is Wieczny Strach. It's about The Death itself, who betrayed her creator, Satan and escaped from hell. Now, after few years, Devil sends 10 of his angels to find, and kill even death. If they die, or come back without death, he will open the gates of hell, and start biblical event, called The Judgement Day. But there will be no god to stop him, only The end itself.

I SENT LINK TO THIS FILM, SO IF SOMEONE IS INTERESTED THEY CAN WATCH.

So, the movie is made by 3 15-yo people. YES. not only this, but at some moment it gets so fucking intense just from the soundtrack. It's not a normal horror movie, since it's telling a story that is not being filmed by cameras or whatever, but has animations, and clips, showing The Devil, Death, (SPOILER - The Angel of Truth  ) and fallen angels. Sadly, it has no English subtitles, so if you don't understand polish language, you will not understand what is going on.
For me, very underrated horror film that has elements I don't think a lot of people ever saw in a horror movie.

There is a near infinite amount of planets with a molten core and I'm gonna venture based on our current discovery of alien races most of them don't have sapient races.  Does that mean they specifically go after other races just to be dicks?  Makes no sense.

I saw it in theaters with someone very important to me, someone who has since passed away. To this day, I can't watch it without tearing up a little.

I can’t speak for anyone else, but that theater experience was unforgettable. As a kid, I couldn’t wrap my head around how they pulled off the animation, the angles, the sense of movement, the way it felt like we were surfacing through water. It was stunning.

And to add another layer, the person I saw it with was a big fan of Jim Varney, who voiced a character in the film. Atlantis was his final role, which made it all the more meaningful.

movies,1ls23ox,ID4,"Mandatory rewatching, my (half baked, moronic, and otherwise) observations

- Russell Case is a god damn American Icon in this household. There was a post the other day about movies that hit different as a parent, this is definitely one of them. Both Case and Whitmore, and to a lesser extent Vivica A Fox, they just come across differently, as great parents. On that note...there have been multi-mile wide alien space ships hovering over American cities for a day, they have obliterated New York, DC, LA, Atlanta, and others...you are literally about to send a squadron of volunteer amateur pilots to fight them...why is the god damn Colonel from Area 51 giving Russell side eye when he tells them he was abducted by aliens 10 years ago?  

- President Whitmore ""I have a beautiful, young, brunette in bed with me"". His wife ""Her!?!"" Once you see that its Mae Whitman, your eyes lock onto her everytime just expecting her to do something quirky and cute like make a mayonegg. 

- Dr Oakenshits or whatever is wildly irresponsible. They have this ship and 3 cadavers for 40 years, and Whitmore is right - they've done absolutely nothing and learned even less about them in that time. Then, he gets a new subject, who's merely unconscious (confirmed, not dead) and does a casual autopsy with little more that a face mask for protection. The same aliens who were wiping them out without breaking a sweat. THERE WERE ROBOTS IN 1996, IM SURE THEY HAD SOME AT AREA FUCKING 51. The part i don't see get mentioned much is how...advanced that alien is. Pay attention and you'll see he's manipulating Oakenshits voice box, forcing him to talk (way back I just assumed it was the telepathy they referenced earlier).  

- Vivicas titanic thunder thigh problem. So, i dont have the math, but stay with me. This gigantic warship, that is several miles wide, produces a beam of pure energy that wipes out a 1,000 foot tall building in an instant. This strike produces a concussive blast that wipes out the entirety of New York City and greater Los Angeles (or at least what looks to be several miles wide radii). Viv sees this happening from her car, struggles out of the seat, throws a few bags out the back seat, grabs her son, and is able to run 50 yards or so, kick open a maintenance door, all in time to not just avoid the concussive blast, but call to the dog. The dog I can get...but Will Smith literally calls her ""chicken legs"" earlier in the film.  

- This kid man...he's going through the rubble in the background, picking up random toys and collecting them. How far away are the kids who used to own them? He does this repeatedly in quick glances. THESE ARE NOT HIS TOYS, those were in the car that was obliterated.  

- Where did the dog shit? It's not an inconsequential question. Think about how dogs react to fireworks. This dog was in the middle of a nuclear alien assault, then transported to Area 51. He clearly wouldn't have been allowed outside during the attack. Did they just...put him in with the now-dead alien?

- Think youve had a bad day? Imagine how many supervisors were crawling up that alien longshoremans ass after he tractor beamed in a foreign craft that hadnt been seen in 40 years and then a virus was detected coming from his quadrant (well, prior to having a several ton warhead fired up his ass). We see a supervisor literally coming to check in on him (and presumably be the 20th person give him shit about his mistake) as the warhead goes off.  

- So, Whitmore...he was a Gulf War pilot. Clearly, the Uber ecohippie who suckerpunched him didnt vote for him. Vivica (a low income stripper with a heart of gold single mother) says she ""voted for the other guy""...just *how* upset would he have been that New York and LA were obliterated...California and New York are now swing states (im ignoring ID4.2)  

- The random guy in the Harley hat, who's part of the volunteer airmen. The camera has him just off center constantly, he's high fiving, he's almost in focus. And yet... he gets 0 lines and is one of our key identifiers of that group. Comes across weird to me, like they wanted him to be distinct, but didnt have anything for him to do.

movies,1lrzk70,"What are some movies that as you got older, you go back to and have a very different experience? Groundhog Day for me for sure.","Gotta say, when I first saw Groundhog Day, I thought it was just this dumb, funny movie. Bill Murray stuck in some miserable town, surrounded by annoying people and his coworkers like Chris Elliott and random locals who just wouldn’t leave him alone. I mean, even I was annoyed by Stephen Tobolowsky. But that was the joke, right? You watched it for Bill's facial expressions as he gets tortured by the same day over and over again. That was the whole appeal, it was funny.

But then you get older, and suddenly you're like, Whoa. That’s life, man. Yeah it's funny but it's also absurd and kind of sad.

The movie’s actually...kind of deep when you watch it when you're older. Cause you realize real life is surprisingly repetitive. There are days you wake up and feel exactly like Bill Murray—trapped in the same job, having the same small talk with the same people you secretly can’t stand. And you just want out. Suddenly, those suicide scenes? Not so funny anymore.

Bill isn’t just this smug, narcissistic jerk getting what he deserves. Well... he kind of is. But then you start to realize so are you. You think you're better than everyone around you. That you're destined for more. That this isn't the life you were meant to live.

Okay, maybe that’s just me.

Maybe you guys all got your lives together and you’re mature and selfless. Not me though and honestly, I kind of hate how relatable the movie has become.

It felt like an incredibly unique window into some form of Northern Britain in the 1980s, but I don't think I quite understood the tone of the movie a lot of the time.

It deals with so many things that, especially from the lens of a totally modern viewer, many of us would see as hugely problematic, dysfunctional, even traumatic, but every time I was starting to feel like the movie was settling into being a critique of these things, perhaps as the grim consequences start to pile up, it then hits you with a moment of levity that seems to slightly disrespect the severity of the issues at hand. Perhaps the ending of the movie being so wacky has retroactively made me feel less certain about the tone of the rest of it...

In a weird way, it actually reminded me a bit of 'Heathers', the original movie (1989), but watching Rita, Sue and Bob Too made me miss the straightforwardness of Heathers' satire in the sense that I never doubted the writers were showing us a bunch of horrible shit, even if it was presented in a funny way, and even if we were supposed to sympathise with why people end up cunts.

In Rita, Sue and Bob Too, I just couldn't quite tell if the movie was sometimes pulling its punches on how damning to be about some heinous act. And don't get me wrong, I'd consider myself pretty sort of 'sex positive' if that's the right way to describe it, and I actually thought that was a great angle in the movie overall, but surely even in 1987 (release date of movie) you'd expect the older dude in this movie to catch some serious flack in his closing scene, not just get a goofy 'oh what are men like?! hahaaa' ending.

movies,1lrxnup,I have seen every Liam Neeson action movie and ranked them.,"I enjoy Liam Neeson action movies because he doesn't just phone it in like other older action stars making action movies. They have a decent plot, well shot, and his acting is always good. The action is mostly well done, but some have a lot of cuts and bad editing. I will rate them in order of: 1: Action. 2: Story. 3: Everything else.

I'm only ranking pure action movies, and he has to be the **main protagonist**.



1. **Taken** - The one that started it all and still the best one. Great story and action.

2. **Run All Night** - One of his best when it comes to pure action, and the plot is interesting with some twists.

3. **Non-Stop** - Pure adrenaline, set on an Airplane, intriguing plot and twists.

4. **Unknown** - Another one with great plot and twists. Action movie with mystery.

5. **Darkman** - This is an underrated movie, it's a comic book adaptation, but I'll count it as an action movie.

6.  **A Walk Among the Tombstones** - Detective movie with action and good story.

7. **The Commuter** - Similar to Non-Stop but set on a train and just a fun movie.

8. **Honest Thief** - Liam Neeson doing what he does best. Not bad.

9. **Cold Pursuit** - Different from his other action movies, but a funny action movie with dark humor. 

10. **The Marksman** - Liam Neeson against the cartel, say no more.

11. **Memory** - Generic action movie, not much to say.

12. **Taken 2** - Disappointing sequel compared to original.

13. **The Ice Road** - Not a bad movie, but it's more of a disaster movie with some action.

14. **Retribution** - Below average. The whole movie takes place in a car, with some twists, and can be boring.

15. **Absolution** - Yea this is one of his worst action movie, bad plot, bad acting, only little action scenes.

16. **Blacklight** - Literally unwatchable trash with boring plot, avoid it. How did this cost 40m??

17. **Taken 3** - Just for the fence scene, this deserves last place.",390,186,1751676003.0,Discussion,0.84,True,False,neotekx,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lrxnup/i_have_seen_every_liam_neeson_action_movie_and/,new,low

movies,1lrw721,Possession (1981) is an absolutely batshit insane movie - I'm still not sure how I really feel about it,"Just finished this 1980s horror cult classic and holy shit bruh...this movie is the definition of ""wtf did I just watch?"". Just an absolutely bonkers, over-the-top story that's equal parts genius and ridiculous. 

It took me a little bit of time to really latch on to the narrative, because it's so purposefully heightened and melodramatic. The dizzying camerawork, the unhinged, overacted performances and the gradually escalating luridness creates a truly demented and nightmarish atmosphere. Honestly, it's worth watching for pure vibes alone. 

Isabelle Adjani is what everyone talks about when mentioning Possession, and I think her performance mostly lives up to the hype. It's just complete commitment to the role, no holds barred. The infamous subway scene is as wild and jaw-dropping as advertised. Sam Neill deserves a lot of credit too, for playing a character almost as fucking nutty as his wife. His portrayal of a man seeing his marriage fall apart and realizing he has no control over it is pretty damn impressive.

In fact, the first thing that I thought of when I finished it is that Andrzej Zulawski was definitely fuckin' going through it. The entire narrative felt like a representation of a man experiencing the end of his marriage, not being able to come to terms with it and desperately doing whatever he can to hold on to a relationship that's already over and beyond repair. To that end, the ending, >!with the creature turning into a ""better"" version of Mark, seems to indicate that he's been well and truly replaced!<

Really, the horror element is surprisingly almost a sidenote - I was expecting the movie to have much more straight-up horror-esque elements than it actually did. This isn't bad really, just unexpected. The squid monster thing seems almost symbolic a lot of the time. 

In terms of why I'm conflicted about the movie...even though I found it fun, well-made and something I'll probably remember for a while, the extremely heightened nature of the story and the atmosphere is a *lot* to take. The entire movie is one giant crash-out, everybody speaks like they're in a mental institution, there's sooo much screaming and yelling, and unless you remind yourself that it's purposefully designed to be absurd, the campy overacting can be grating and unintentionally hilarious.

With that being said - this is a truly unique cinematic experience. It really feels like a waking nightmare and it never stops making you feel uncomfortable - which is really what the best horror movies manage to achieve.

Apparently there's a remake in the works, which to me seems like an awful idea. The untethered, no-limit insanity of this movie is what makes it work and I really can't see a modern remake capturing the tone - or a modern actress embodying what Isabelle Adjani pulled off.

movies,1lrt03x,Aesthetically Pleasing Movies,"Have you ever ended up liking a film (perhaps more than you typically would) just because of the way it looks and its style? Or maybe it's a good film but the visuals really enhance it or standout - e.g. the cinematography, set design or even certain camera angles/shots.

Here's some of my random ones:

- Constantine (2005) starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz. I love this movie because the whole thing looks like it happens at night (even during the daytime scenes). Some camera angles are straight out of a comic book and the colouring is good too. I think during the directors commentary they said it was purposely coloured with browns and reds to look like the pits of hell.

An obvious one:

- Sin City (2005) starring Bruce Willis and Jessica Alba. All in black and white with only a few tinges of colour. Very cool effect. The Spirit (2008) uses a similar effect, however isn't considered as good a film.

An obscure one:

- I Am Vengeance (2018) starring Wade Barrett and Anna Shaffer. Not particularly a great film (by reviews) but I love it because of the cool camera angles, shadows and shots of the GTO car. It's like a throwback to those 80s/90s action films.

A modern one:

- The Batman (2022) starting Robert Pattinson and Zoe Kravitz. A really great take on Gotham City and the look of the film gives great underbelly waiting to combust vibes.

movies,1lrrt85,Is a critically acclaimed Dinosaur movie possible post Jurassic Park?,"After getting to see Jurassic World:Rebirth last week and seeing the reaction prior to release, this question has been on my mind. As a big fan Of Gareth Edwards and his work, especially Godzilla (2014), I was a bit saddened to see the general reaction of critics to Rebirth, as I had a lot of hope that it would be at least somewhat well received.

Before we get into a massive Argument about how “critic reviews don’t matter” and “only the Audience matters”. I totally understand where people are coming from, and there are PLENTY of films that I love personally that were absolutely shit on by critics.But I still think that critics have their place. Critics generally see significantly more film than the  average moviegoer. And while I don’t think critics always determine the success of a film (the entire Jurassic franchise is evidence of that), I do think that they can be better judges of quality in a lot of instances. Critic ratings are also the make or break for some people who might do research before wanting to go and see a film (I myself have been guilty of this a number of times), so I think whenever a movie is well received, especially when it’s a franchise you like, it’s a big plus. 

Which brings me back to the original question. The Jurassic Park franchise has had a hard streak of being negatively received, with the past 3 Jurassic world films now all being rated as Rotten.  And it’s not just the Jurassic franchise either, 65 was an absolute dumpsterfire, and I honestly have no high hopes for Primitive war either. 

With the latest installment of Rebirth, it seems like the most common critique is that it doesn’t exactly do anything new or changes the formula of the previous films. And while I actually liked Rebirth, and thought it was a visually stunning film, I absolutely understand where they are coming from with this. Which begs the additional question, what needs to be done for a Dinosaur film to be a hit with not only fans, but movie snobs as well?

I think the first thing that comes to people’s mind might be something like a “book accurate” horror adaptation of Chrichtons Jurassic Park, and while I’d absolutely love to see that just as much as anybody, as long as Spielberg is alive, it’s pretty much a given that a reboot isn’t going to happen anytime soon, if ever. 

The next thing I could think of is what I’d call a “Nosferatu” scenario, where a genuinely good dinosaur horror could be made, and be very faithful to the source material of Michael Chrichtons Jurassic Park, but under a different name to hopefully avoid copyright. The obstacle of this however, is the Chrichton estate appears to be very trigger happy for lawsuits, especially after seeing them going after HBO for “the Pitt” accusing the show of being an unapproved sequel of ER. 

The last thing I could see and really hope for, is for Darren Naish to get his pitch for a big budget Dinosaur film approved. Naish is a paleontologist who has worked on tons of paleo-media, most recently Jon Favreaus Prehistoric planet, which id argue is only second to Walking with dinosaurs (1999) as the greatest Dinosaur TV-series to ever exist. If he gets something going, I’d have a lot of faith that he’d be able to pull something off that’s good. 

To end my rambling I’m gonna leave off with this, what do you think needs to be done to see a praised Dino film in the future? If it’s even possible at all? And if there are any critics creeping around, what exactly do you guys want to see in a future film??

Whether it was a recent release, a classic like Basudev or Jhola, or something you just stumbled upon on YouTube or a streaming platform, what was your overall experience? Did you enjoy it, find it interesting, or perhaps a bit challenging to watch? Share your thoughts!
Nepali cinema, often affectionately called 'Kollywood' by some, has a unique charm and its own set of strengths and challenges. While it might not have the global reach of Bollywood or Hollywood, many Nepali films offer a truly authentic glimpse into Nepali culture, society, and diverse landscapes, from the bustling streets of Kathmandu to the serene villages in the Himalayas.
I'm particularly interested in hearing about your first impressions. Did anything about the storytelling, acting, music, or even the technical aspects surprise you? Were there any specific themes that resonated with you, perhaps related to family values, social issues, or historical events? Given that we're here in Kathmandu, it's a topic that feels very relevant to local conversations about media and identity.
I know some recent films like Jaaari, Pashupati Prasad, Kalo Pothi, and the Kabaddi series have garnered significant attention both within Nepal and among the Nepali diaspora. If you've seen any of these, or perhaps older gems like Kagbeni or Loot, I'd love to hear your specific reviews. What worked for you, and what didn't?
On the other hand, if you haven't watched any Nepali films, what has deterred you? Is it accessibility, lack of awareness, or perhaps past experiences that haven't piqued your interest?

movies,1lrjrzn,Hear me out: Death Becomes Her is basically a dark comedy version of Sunset Boulevard,"
Both films centre around aging actresses who refuse to accept that their youth and fame are long gone. Norma Desmond and Madeline Ashton are basically cut from the same cloth. They’re both living in fantasy worlds, surrounded by reminders of their past glory, doing everything they can to pretend time hasn’t touched them. Norma clings to old film reels and delusions of a comeback. Madeline drinks a potion and literally becomes immortal. Different tone, same fear, irrelevance.

They also share this intense jealousy when “their” man starts loving someone else. In Sunset Boulevard, it’s Joe Gillis. In Death Becomes Her, it’s Ernest. That jealousy builds until it tips over into madness and, eventually, murder. Both women go down with the ship, clutching their illusions of beauty and control.

And here’s a detail I’ve always found weirdly perfect. When Norma first meets Joe, she mistakes him for a mortician. But in Death Becomes Her, Ernest actually is a mortician. He literally specializes in making the dead look alive. The symbolism is so on the nose it almost loops back around to genius.

Of course, the tones are completely different. Sunset Boulevard is noir tragedy, Death Becomes Her is full-blown camp. But they’re both sharp critiques of Hollywood’s obsession with youth, beauty, and fame. One just plays it straight, the other goes off the rails in the best way possible.

So yeah. Sunset Boulevard walked so Death Becomes Her could teeter in wearing heels, half a spine, and a wildly inappropriate hat.

movies,1lrif3z,Why is it that movie antiheroes are seen as such by audiences but tv antiheroes are often seen as heroes by audiences?,"I have noticed that quite often, when a movie character is supposed to be the antiheroes, audiences are generally quick to recognize him or her as that, even if they root for said character, they still see this character as not really a typical hero. Patrick Bateman, Alex DeLarge, Dirty Harry Callahan, Barry Lyndon, The Man With No Name, Tyler Durden, Tom Ripley, etc. There are exceptions, but for the most part audiences seem to be in on the fact that the protagonist is not an ideal hero one should root for otherwise. 

By contrast, when a tv character is supposed to be an antihero, audiences generally assumed him or her to be the hero and actively root for him or her. This generally happens with Tony Soprano or Walter White. Legions of fans love these guys and hate their antagonists like their wives, especially Skylar. 

Why is this the case? Why are movie antiheroes seen as such and appreciated for that while tv antiheroes are generally mistaken for heroes by the audience? Is it because movies are better at portraying antiheroes than tv is? Is it because movie audiences understand and recognize them better than tv audiences do? 

I think that one explanation could be found in the history of both media. Before the Hays Code, there were several 1930s gangster movies like Scarface or Little Caesar that had anti heroic protagonists. James Cagney became the face of the antihero gangster. As late as 1939, Gone With the Wind had perhaps cinema’s first female antihero, Scarlet O’Hara, an icon ever since. When the code was lifted in the 60s, there was an explosion of anti hero films, such as Bonnie and Clyde, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Dirty Harry, The Dollars Trilogy, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Pulp Fiction, Easy Rider, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Psycho, etc. Movie antiheroes are not slowing down. 

By contrast tv only recently started having antiheroes, with shows like Breaking Bad and The Sopranos coming out in the late 90s and early aughts. Perhaps tv has not had enough time to deal with antiheroes the way that cinema has. Perhaps tv audiences are not used to having antihero protagonists the way that movie fans have been able to since the early days of cinema.

I sincerely do find Don more scary than Anton because Don Logan is the sort of psychotic you might have even experienced in life - he wears violence on his sleeve, he is unhinged, and needs to be in absolute control, but under the surface, you have this tormented soul who is anything but in control. When Gal tries to leave his life of crime behind him and just relax in Spain, Don is tasked with offering him a job to do, when Gal refuses, things get tense. 

This film does not have masses of physical violence.. the violence is psychological, and it comes in spades in this film. I promise you that you will love this film - you might want sub titles because the cockney accents are strong with this one.

movies,1lra4e0,Earnest Movies Are In The Same Universe As Back To The Future,"""These are my boys. Jules. And Verne.""

""Hey Verne!""

It's clear these two franchises share the same universe. But let's discuss it. First, who is Verne?

Verne Brown of course creates the Biff character through temporal resonance.

Earnest on the other hand:

Met Santa  
Avoided the law  
Summoned troll demons  
Gained superpowers to join the NBA  
Survived African warlords

Basically he's a Leprechaun, and his purpose is to tie up knots in history. He is attracted to Verne, who, in later life is attempting to avoid Langolier like demons that hunt time travelers. While Verne has the tech to stave off the Langoliers, Earnest is like a moth to flame, always interfering in Verne's life and and causing chaos.

Verne accepts this knowing that what Earnest is is a thing that wouldn't destroy him, only bring chaos and annoyance. So he tolerates Earnest. In some ways, Earnest wards off, through metaphysical stink, Langolier type entities.

movies,1lr8bp3,A Movie I Would Love To Watch,"It's been bothering me like crazy so I thought of dumping this somewhere. ANYWHERE.

Basically, the movie is like those detective/noir style kinda movie. But instead of the camera shots being like you see normally, it's by room on one perspective. Like you're watching a theatre play being done on stage but on you're screen. 

Movie starts with a grieving widow who had lost her husband. Her husband had been murdered in his bed. The detective works on the case and comforts the widow. Soon, stuff unfolds and it's been found out that the deceased husband had been cheating on the wife. She was suspected but in the end, the mistress was convicted for murder. 

Here's the twist. 

Right at the end, the mistress and her partner gets arrested and it was chaos. And THEN, the screen just ZOOMS in. For the first time, the scene changes. It zooms in to the widow in the middle of the room as she grieves. It zooms into her face in which she covers with her well manicured hands. Red nail polish. It also shows a mark on her finger where her wedding band used to sit on. And then, she drops her hands, and she shows a cold face. Lighting changes to red. A song like I SEE RED by Everybody Loves An Outlaw starts playing. 

Then it zooms out to her already knowing that her husband had been cheating on her long before. Then her systematically planning her own husband's murder and framing it on the mistress. 

AHHHHHHHH. I feel much better now that I dumped it all here. 

This story isn't exactly new or one of a kind. But, what drives me insane is if the movie could be made in the perspective that I mentioned earlier. Like a play on a stage. Camera is unmoving, only the characters move about. As for the reveal of the widow, it'd be crazy if the perspective changes. It's not the play anymore. The camera follows her along, basically showing that the entire movie was a play she had orchestrated for her revenge. 

I would absolutely love to watch this. 

There were 2 songs that inspired me.

I like the final fight between Arnold and the predator, I like the score, I like the design of the predator. I also like how this is kind of a slasher movie with the crew getting killed off one by one, it seperates it from other action movies.

movies,1lr4nsi,What movie has the best platonic relationship between a guy and a girl?,"There are many people that argue that a guy and a girl can’t JUST be friends, especially if both parties are heterosexual. Because depending on how close they become, it is usually inevitable that they will become sexually and emotionally attracted to the other. 

However, I personally believe the opposite and that it is possible for a guy and a girl to be very close without there being any hints of romance. 

One good example that I can think of is the friendship between Jess and Leslie from the Disney film; Bridge to Terabithia (2007)! Their friendship was the heart and overall story of the movie, and it was so heartwarming to watch that friendship develop before it took a devastating turn with Leslie’s death. 

Sure it could be argued that Jess was realizing that he was romantically falling in love with Leslie, and there were some hints of a romance sparking between them before she died. But it was still a great friendship, where there was a great deal of love between them without needing to become a couple.

movies,1lr0xge,Moments when intrusive ADR has ruined a scene?,"L.A. Confidential (1997) is one of my favorite films. It's pretty much perfect, except for one piece of absolutely terrible ADR. It's about an hour and a half into the movie, when Ed Exley (played by Guy Pearce) goes to talk to the Medical Examiner. The director cuts to an over-the-shoulder two shot of Exley and the M.E., who is in the middle of speaking during the cut. The M.E. says ""Hell of a last supper, don't you think, lieutenant?"" via ADR, and it doesn't even sound like the same actor is speaking. The quality of the recording is totally different and the pace of speech and phrasing abruptly shifts. Pearce doesn't react to the question at all, because it was never actually said to him during shooting, and the whole thing feels super abrupt and amateurish in an otherwise amazing film.

I cannot find this scene on YouTube despite a lot of searching, but if you've seen the movie surely you know what I'm talking about (and if you can find it, I will be in your debt).

I just finished watching Weathering With You. It's great - but I also feel like it wasn't developed properly towards the end. I think it could've turned into a much more complex and beautiful film, but it's just my opinion!

- **The first half** was great: new interesting characters, visuals are amazing, it's honestly entertaining.

- **Second half** was... too obvious? I can't help but wonder what if Hodaka was unknowingly the cause of the rain, stemming from his traumatic past (like abusive parents or a sibling's death), with Hina acting as a healing presence? Their relationship would then be complicated not just by circumstance, but by their opposing weather roles, creating a deeper, symbolic conflict that could be resolved if Hodaka came to terms with his past..

This film had a HUGE potential! I just have so many ideas of alternative endings that my head is exploding 😂

movies,1lqyw4s,"Let's discuss ""Basic Instinct 2""(2006), the maligned sequel to ""Basic Instinct"" - Where did it go wrong and is there anything positive you can find in it?","Positive - Sharon Stone looked amazing in it. The costume design had her wear some fabulous, sexy stuff. Charlotte Rampling is always a welcome presence in movies. Even with shit like this. Ironically, she plays against type. I've never seen her be this cheery and lively in a movie. 

But the movie is AWFUL. First, where is the sex? If you're going to make a sequel to the 90s most popular erotic thriller, it needs to have loads of sex but the movie is surprisingly prudish. There are only two sex scenes and they're quick. They even deleted a bissexual threesome. The question I had was why. How do you do a Erotic thriller and not make it sexy?

Another thing that pissed me off about Catherine Tramell in this movie is that they just made her into a horny slut. Catherine was sexual but she wasn't obvious and she was more into women than men. This sequel pretty much ignores Catherine's bissexuality as well as her devilish flirtiness and mind games. Every line that comes out of her mouth is her saying the most stereotypical ""I love sex and I'm evil for it"" dialogue. 

And David Morrissey is no Michael Douglas. Douglas had that dramatic masculinity that worked perfectly as a counterpoint to Stone's brazen sensuality and master manipulation. Morrissey is just doing a generic morally ambiguous character. He's too weak to truly serve as a rival to Stone. 

I also missed Paul Verhoeven's atmospheric direction. Michael Caton-Jones is a good director but Basic Instinct was a Universe he didn't seem to understand. If Verhoeven couldn't do it, they should have given Mike Figgis the directorial role. I think he might have made a much more daring and brave movie instead of Caton-Jones' safer approach.",0,1,1751571794.0,Discussion,0.48,True,False,PM_Peartree,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lqyw4s/lets_discuss_basic_instinct_22006_the_maligned/,new,low

movies,1lqynfu,This post centers on Warner Animation Group/Warner Bros. Pictures Animation's Toto.,"*Toto* is an animated musical based on the 2017 book *Toto: The Dog-Gone Amazing Story of the Wizard of Oz*, which was written by Michael Morpugo and illustrated by Emma Chichester Clark, and tells the Wizard of Oz story from the perspective of Toto. The film was first announced to be in the works in July of 2018, with Warner Animation Group (now called Warner Bros. Pictures Animation) producing. Mark Burton would adapt the book, with Jared Stern and Winsor Yuan executive producing through their company A Stern Talking To. In January of 2020, John August was announced to write the film, and in October that same year, Alex Timbers was announced to be directing, with Derek Frey producing. By February of 2021, preproduction had begun, and Animal Logic was on board with the film set to be animated at the VFX/animation studio's Vancouver place. In December of 2021, the film was reported to have a release date of February 2, 2024; however, in April of 2023, the film was reported to have been moved off that date, with Barry Levinson's mobster film *The Wise Guys* (later titled *The Alto Knights*) taking it. *Toto* would be, per [*Deadline Hollywood*](https://deadline.com/2023/04/aquaman-2-minecraft-wise-guys-color-purple-release-dates-1235318958/), ""for the moment"" undated. *The Alto Knights* would end up getting pushed to November 15, 2024, and was finally released on March 21, 2025.

Then, on November 9, 2023, it was reported that fellow Warner Animation Group film *Coyote vs Acme.* would not be released, and a $30-million tax write-off would be taken for the film. What does the now-set-to-be-released-by-Ketchup-Entertainment-in-2026-film have to do with *Toto*? *Coyote vs. Acme* was set to be released on July 21, 2023, but on April 26, 2022, fellow Warner Bros. Pictures film *Barbie* took that release date, with *Coyote vs. Acme* become undated. Eventually, [*The Hollywood Reporter*](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/coyote-vs-acme-warner-bros-discovery-115m-write-down-mystery-projects-1235832120/) reported in February of 2024 that ""As part of an earnings filing, Warner Bros. Discovery said it wrote off $115 million in content due to abandoning films in the third quarter of 2023 as part of a 'strategic realignment plan associated with the Warner Bros. Pictures Animation group.'""

Going back to *Toto*, there hasn't been any updates on it since its removal from Warner Bros. Pictures' release schedule in April of 2023. A [*Collider*](https://collider.com/wizard-of-oz-animated-toto/) article about the film was published on Decmeber 26, 2023, stating ""*Toto’s* fate also seems to have been sealed by Warner Bros. brass shelving ***Coyote vs. Acme***, another title championed by the last Warner Bros. Animation regime. While the studio eventually relented and let other studios look at purchasing *Coyote vs. Acme*, that was only after a massive outcry from the public. **If the studio was willing to toss out a finished Wile E. Coyote movie, then a Toto feature was certainly going on the chopping block for a quick tax write-off.**""

Animator Uli Meyer, who served as a character designer for *Toto* (according to IMDb) posted [a set of eight images on Instagram on June 28 of this year](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLc2LS4MH8v/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). The now-edited post reads:

""A few years ago I worked on a project that was tremendous fun. A lot of talented artists were involved. It was one of those where you throw hundreds of designs into the pot and everything is great but nothing is ever followed up. Then it suddenly stopped. The people you were talking to on a weekly basis were never heard from again. Recently, many years later, I heard that the project is dead. Many of us have been there and for me this isn't the only one.""

Meyer [confirmed something else a day later](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLc2LS4MH8v/c/18089264644657605/r/18093123124618294/?img_index=1), and character designer Tona Grasa [replied](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLc2LS4MH8v/c/18066438440027860/) to the original post with

""Gorgeous work! I worked on this project along some amazing designers at Animal Logic after this.

movies,1lqyahl,I'm going to be honest; I've never understood the elitism of practical affects over CGI.,"What I've heard said the most over my life has been ""CGI looks fake!"" ""it has feelings of the uncanny valley!"" or ""CGI doesn't age well!"" which is kind of a double-edged sword because there are plenty of practical affects feel like this too and they can look even worse than CGI. A good example is Terminator 1 where Arnie removes his eye. I remember the first time I saw that and thought ""Ugh, that didn't look so hot."" Also no matter what, I know that the dinosaur I'm seeing on film isn't real so my suspension of disbelief is already holding up even if it's CGI or not. Alot of the time bad CGI is just rushed CGI. Good CGI goes totally unnoticed because, well it's good while I feel like you can always point out something that's practical because well, it's still not real. Mad Max Fury Road is a great example of top tier practice affects but again, I know everything in that film isn't exactly real so I'm not bothered by any of it.

IMO it feels like when I was younger, and adults were hating on animated films and anime saying they were for kids simply because they weren't done live. Both have strengths and weaknesses but saying one is vastly superior to the other feels wrong to say for me because I can easily watch the 80's The Thing, The Prequel and the OG and look at the affect an say ""That's one nasty ass monster"" because again, I know it's all fake regardless. It doesn't matter if it's good or bad effects what matters is if the intent and emotion of the creator is being felt IMO. Like some examples being Kirk vs The Gorn or Neo when he fought like 1000 Smith's during the Matrix 2. Those are both moments of simply bad affects that I think we can all just laugh at.

Also, to this entire point, I honestly can't remember the last time I saw bad effects in a movie. There was one death in the new Final Destination that I thought looked a bit off but it wasn't really a bad effect just a bad transition into effects.",0,24,1751570307.0,Discussion,0.14,True,False,Knalxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lqyahl/im_going_to_be_honest_ive_never_understood_the/,new,low
movies,1lqy8e1,Different movies based on the same subject,"We all know about twin movies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_films?wprov=sfti1#) but I’ve always been interested in movies that are based on the same subject, released at different time periods.

One well known example is Alive and Society of the Snow, both based on the miracle in the Andes. Alive was released in 1993 and is a Hollywood adaptation of the event while Society of the Snow was released in 2023 and is a more authentic Spanish language production. There was even a low budget exploitation film called Survive! based on the event released in 1976!

Another example would be the multitude of movies based on the Titanic sinking, most notably A Night to Remember (1958) and Titanic (1997).

I’ve always found this phenomenon fascinating because it allows us to see different takes on subjects, and with newer releases, we’re able to see more immersive depictions as technology evolves.

Are there other examples of this that you can think of? It can be adaptations of anything from books to real life events to video games.

**From Kyle:** 

Hey! I’m Kyle Buchanan and I serve as [The Projectionist](https://www.nytimes.com/column/the-projectionist), the awards season columnist for The New York Times. 

I cover the movie industry and pop culture for the Times, reporting from film festivals like Cannes and Venice and writing profiles of major movie stars including [Daniel Craig](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/20/movies/daniel-craig-queer.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.U8jx.7d-4ger4UXMk&smid=re-nytimes), [Jennifer Lawrence](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/02/movies/jennifer-lawrence-causeway.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.tKWd.S0GSQcqLjW1Y&smid=re-nytimes), [Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/movies/wicked-cynthia-erivo-ariana-grande.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.PElh.CByDLRMS-eBU&smid=re-nytimes).  

I also wrote the best-selling book “Blood, Sweat & Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road,” and would like to note that even though George Miller’s action masterpiece placed at #11 on our list, I personally think it should have been even higher. 

**From Leah:** 

Hi there, I’m Leah Greenblatt! 

I write primarily about movies and books for The Times, covering everything from[ the return of the raunchy sex comedy](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/13/movies/sex-comedies-no-hard-feelings-joy-ride.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.Wosq.1BhmODMjJ9H-&smid=re-nytimes) to classic celebrity profiles (like [Michael Keaton reprising his role in “Beetlejuice” last year](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/05/movies/michael-keaton-beetlejuice-beetlejuice.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.3G3w.ZduBBinIb5db&smid=re-nytimes).)

This is my second time working on a major NYT culture list: I helped put together the [100 best books of the 21st century](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/books/best-books-21st-century.html?unlocked_article_code=1.TU8.uK6T.Ul-9LJm0ROFE&smid=re-nytimes), which some of our readers are still debating more than a year later. I love the conversations that these lists lead to, and what they can tell us about ourselves.

All of these links are available for free, even without an NYT subscription.

Ask us anything about how the list came to be.

movies,1lqohrj,Clash of titans within the Stathamverse,"As a fan of Jason Statham movies, I have for long wondered what would happen if many of the Statham characters are pitted against each other in an ultimate showdown.  I re-watched all of the movies with the following characters to assess the strengths and weakness of each character and who would finally emerge on top. The Character and movies I focused on are: 1. Frank Martin (The Transporter) 2. Levon Cade (A Working Man) 3. Phil Broker (Homefront) 4. Arthur Bishop (The Mechanic) 5. H (Wrath of Man) 6. Adam Clay (The Beekeeper). Based on all of these movies, I think Adam Clay i.e The Beekeeper will emerge on top. This is because the guy barely got a scratch while fighting all the way through to the Presidential level security and he was done with most villains within a minute. Other characters are are ex-special forces, master criminals, or skilled drivers but Adam Clay is part of this mysterious Beekeeper organization that operates above governments and even they gave up after sending one operative after him.

What impressed me about the character was that when he discovers he’s in a world that never knew the Beatles he was pretty much ready to make that music and write those songs. And it got me thinking if I woke up in a world that was devoid of something could I fill that gap?  

I couldn’t think of a single thing where I either had the knowledge or the skill to fill that void.  But there are lots of things that would be such a shame if the world had never known it.  The recipe for Pizza or apple pie?  A world that never knew Van Gogh or the sport of ice hockey?

movies,1lqhqao,Days of Thunder,"Remember watching this back in the day as a youngster and there was also a ride at Great America on it (Paramount Theme Park).  I get that it was probably made due to the increasing popularity with NASCAR at the time and Hollywood was looking for a quick paycheck. 

But man I gotta say, this is a true classic.  Rewatching it, it is an awesome move. Good story, stellar cast, and overall great watching experience. If it was re-released on the big screen I would 100% go and see it again. 

I’ll be the first to say I’m not a huge NASCAR fan but my pops is and we’ve watched some races together over the years.  Also just watched the Dale Earnhardt documentary and it hit hard. I remember when he died, it was a big deal and eventually led to some pretty drastic changes in the sport from which Day of Thunder portrays. 

All in all I think it’s a great movie and they just don’t make them the way they used to.  Here’s to 90s movies, should they live on forever as the best years movies were ever made!

Personally, I find it a bit odd that after the events of the movie, the ending has Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart looking for a new house to move into. I definitely get it, it was a traumatic experience and they probably just didn't want to continue living in the house where everything went down or deal with the damage that was done to the house, but it just felt like the decison to move was a bit rash. 

I'd argue that the preceding events just went to show why staying there could be a good thing. The panic room came in handy on the very first night in the house, and likely saved their lives. Of course the chance is small, and home invasions may not be super common, but what if you move into a new place with no panic room and find yourself facing down another home invasion? I'd feel better knowing I had a tried and true safety net so to speak.

movies,1lqag8r,Alice in wonderland (1951),"I have just rewatched Alice in wonderland  for the first time in years, I’ve heard many people talking about how it has no plot, is all a dream etc. 

I completely disagree, I think the plot is Alice’s journey from doing as she it told, to realising her true potential  by following her intuition and do what she wants to do rather than following rules set by everyone else. 

In the beginning, she speaks about what her world would be like, everything would be opposite. This is Alice expressing her feelings of confusion and discontent with the expectations forced upon her in life, wishing she lived in a world where she is free to be her true self which is imperfect but not rejected or questioned for being herself.

Throughout the story Alice questions what she is supposed to to do, following the lead of others, chasing after different characters. At the very end, when she meets the queen who symbolises external expectations, social rules and the pressure to be perfect. She finally listens to her desires rejecting all expectations forced upon her by ‘beating’ the queen. In this moment she is freed and wakes up. I believe this is the moment she realises her potential, realising that her life journey is up to her, accepting her self fully which is why she wakes at that moment from the ‘dream’.  

As a child I adored the book and all the movies. I am also autistic and I think the reason I loved this story so much is because i saw elements of myself in Alice. I know allistic people are negatively affected by the worlds expectations but for high masking autistic people especially- we know there are expectations but we do not understand them, they confuse us and we fail to meet them far more, feeling constantly rejected and resentful towards the expectations, yearning to understand and to be understood. Alice subtly shows us that we don’t need to make sense of this, when we finally listen to what we want and need and accept that it’s okay to do so- telling us that we will be free when we accept our selves as different rather than accepting the expectations that we do not understand.",6,8,1751498348.0,Discussion,0.62,True,False,Late-Trick1677,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lqag8r/alice_in_wonderland_1951/,new,low

I'm currently developing a crime drama project called The Velvet Trigger (working title: Cum Fiction). It's a personal story I've been building for years, and I'm planning to direct it myself when the time comes.The core of the story revolves around two brothers - Kerem and Dağhan. No spoilers here, but their relationship is at the heart of everything. It's not just about crime or action; it's about loyalty, identity, and how far people can be pushed before they break.I'm aiming for a slow-burn, atmospheric tone - something grounded, emotional, and a bit unsettling. Think character-driven tension rather than non-stop shootouts.All the scripts are already written, but they're flexible and can be adapted depending on whether this turns into a 4-film series or a 6-season TV show. Structurally, the story is designed to work in either format.Right now, I'm focused on refining the world, polishing the characters, and hopefully bringing this vision to life in the near future.Also, as a first step, I'm planning to shoot a short film based on this universe next year - and I'm aiming to submit it to the Cannes Short Film Competition.Would love to hear your thoughts - especially from people who enjoy morally complex characters and slow-burning crime stories.

movies,1lq112t,"Vanessa Redgrave might have won her 2nd Academy Award, had ""Playing For Time"" (1980) come out in theaters","I had the opportunity of watching the TV film, ""Playing for Time"", and I'm still in shock and moved by how exceptional she is in the film. In some scenes, she's reminiscent of Renée Falconetti, her close-ups and what she does with her facial expressions, chef's kiss. 

The cast is superb: Jane Alexander (almost as good as Redgrave, her Alma Rosé is a complex turn of someone who's a victim yet also an opppressor), Melanie Mayron (an innocent who corrupts herself for salvation), Robin Bartlett, Shirley Knight (shocked by her resemblance with Maria Mandl, a sadist with a cheery disposition on the outside), Anna Thomson, Marisa Berenson (striking and lovely), an absolutely terrifying Viveca Lindfors, Christine Baranski (I like her however her wacky turn came off as out of place in a Holocaust film, it's like she was in a musical), Verna Bloom and Maud Adams (I call shade, she doesn't speak once and is in just two scenes). 

You can still see the limitations for a made for Television film yet the performances are excellent and the film doesn't pull any punches, Redgrave delivers a tour de force which, in my mind, is the best performance from a woman in 1980. 

Still, I suspect she might have lost against Sissy Spacek. I would have placed her in Ellen Burstyn's slot or in Mary Tyler Moore's slot (and placed Moore in the Supporting category which she might have won had the studio not dropped the ball).",0,3,1751475257.0,Discussion,0.27,True,False,PM_Peartree,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lq112t/vanessa_redgrave_might_have_won_her_2nd_academy/,new,low

maybe that movie was discussed a hundred times before, but I just watched it so yes.

I finished the movie, looked up some details about it, and saw some old articles criticizing the ending, that many people were upset about the use of the 9/11 tragedy as a ""shocking ending"", saying it was disrespectful.

But I strongly disagree. Yes, the ending was definitely shocking - i had to pause the movie for a few minutes to collect my emotions - but it wasn’t there just for shock value. The entire film is about the main character’s life: his struggles, his relationships, his grief, his growth. We get to know him deeply, as a person - not a statistic or just another name.
That’s exactly the point. The movie reminds that every person who died on 9/11 had a full, complex life like that. They weren’t just numbers in a headline - they had families, fears, plans, habits, routines. We often talk about tragedies in broad terms, don't think too much of victims' lifes, but movie humanizes them.

As for the “shocking ending” part — it would’ve been so stupid if it were done only for the sake of drama🤠. Like it clearly has to have some message. The randomness of it - the way it just happens out of nowhere - mirrors real life. One moment you're thinking about dinner, texting someone, making plans for the weekend, rushing to a work, and the next BOOM. You're dead.

movies,1lpupyp,Law Abiding Citizen (#2),"I just watched *Law Abiding Citizen*, and while the movie has some obvious flaws, I can’t deny that it delivers an intense and addictive experience. The premise grabs you right away: a man whose family is murdered decides to take justice into his own hands, not just against the criminals, but against the entire legal system that failed him. The performances, especially from Gerard Butler and Jamie Foxx, give the story emotional weight and a strong sense of moral tension. There’s something captivating about watching Butler’s character pull off complex, deadly plans from inside a prison cell, always seeming one step ahead. That said, the film starts to fall apart under the weight of its own implausibility; many of the plot points are outright impossible, and the twists,while entertainin, demand you completely suspend your disbelief. The excessive violence and chaotic tone make it hard to take seriously at times, and the message about justice versus revenge gets lost beneath all the explosions and shock value. Still, I understand why a lot of people enjoy it as a guilty pleasure: it’s fast-paced, dark, and holds your attention all the way through.

movies,1lpuenl,Timing of release against demographic competition matters enormously,"Okay this may be a bit of a five am brain worm, but I was rolling over the discussion about how Elio has not been doing great in theaters and how some of the discussion has centered on censorship of LBGT+ themes or because it wasn’t based on an existing IP, but hear me out on this theory:

It didn’t do well because it was a movie aimed for 11-year-old boys nestled in the middle of a run of other movies aimed for the same demographic. Most notable How to Train Your Dragon (which we saw in a packed theater the week before seeing Elio in an empty theater), but also the residual of Minecraft and even Midas’s, Dogman or Paddington in Peru. It can be hard to believe in this thread, but the average American watches only 1.4 movies a in theaters a year, so if you’re a family with a son, you may be tapped out in boy movies from something released a few months ago.

The market for “girl movies” of the same age group has been sparser this past year— Moana 2, which made stupid amounts of money, and Snow White, which, let us say, did not, despite both being non-original characters. Pixar’s most recent “girl movie” Inside Out 2, was also released just at the edge of last year in a year with not a lot of young girl movies.

Of course add to this that 11-year-old boys and girls are choosing smaller screen entertainment like video games and TikTok and there’s just a smaller pie to go around.

movies,1lptzi4,Is the Minority Report actually about Minority Reports?,"I just recently watched the Minority Report for the first time and I thought it was pretty good and definitely unique. That said, I'm a little confused about the minority reports themselves.

The opening half of the movie leads us to believe that minority reports exist as one precog may disagree with the others, and these reports are systematically deleted as to maintain the idea that there is no doubt in the predictions. Someone, e.g. Anderton, finding out about this corruption would be enough to motivate murder and/or a setup as we see in the movie.

The truth is that Anderton learned about a specific murder - that of Anne Lively - and how Burgess recreated a planned attempted murder as to avoid suspicion. This is what gives motivation to the framing of Anderton. 

The system of handling precog dejavu is what hides this murder, not the deleting of minority reports. The presumed dejavu vision(s?), which is actually of a second murder, is deleted.

If minority reports weren't a thing, and the movie (and book) were titled ""Precog dejavu"", things would all fall into place. The precogs have two sets of visions, the second is deleted as it's presumed dejavu and the whole thing is very clever.

So what's the point of the minority reports?

Do minority reports actually occur?

The only way it makes sense is if for the first Anne Lively murder, both male precogs saw the first murder and Agatha sees the second, giving us a minority reports. If so, why didn't all the precogs see both murders of Anne Lively? Wouldn't they all see the first murder, and then some time later once the future is written, see the second?

I'm getting more confused the more I write. I hope some of you can help me

The kingdom where Sophi live is trying to occupie it's neighboor. We know that the palace have magical protection against bombs, but in my theory they don't need it because most of the time they are bombing their own cities just like when they try to catch Howl.

My observations are purely subjective on how a star should or should not stride through a scene. What one person considers a ""bad gait"" another might not even notice or could find appealing. 

That said, I can’t shake the image of Al Pacino waddling along as he leads his henchmen away immediatejy after Carlo Rizzi’s murder. For a man who can hold a scene with his facial intensity alone, that walk just doesn’t match up.

When I was in college, it felt like Scarface was a rite of passage. .every dorm had that poster up. For me, Goodfellas stands out with its pacing and storytelling. If The Godfather is a symphony, Goodfellas is a classic rock anthem . loud, gritty, and unforgettable. I included American Gangster in there as well for a personal preference 

The goal is to pick four films that are the most iconic, influential, and defining in the gangster genre. Some others that should be in the conversation: The Departed, Casino, Blood In Blood Out, and The Untouchables. It’s not just about the violence or the crime, but the legacy each film leaves behind.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone! I’m looking for a very specific movie. I haven’t met anyone that’s seen it but I’m hoping movie buffs in this sub can help. I hope it’s alright to ask. 

When I was a kid I saw a movie in the early 2000’s (possibly late 90’s) about a group of young adults in a house (not sure whose house it was or why they were there). But one by one they were being murdered by a mask figure. Pretty generic but what stood it out was how sexual it was. A lot of nudity and sex. While it wasn’t an actual porn film, there was a lot of nudity and a few memorable scenes: 

A couple is having sex in a large bed with a red canopy. On the (I guess) ceiling of the canopy is a large mirror. The masked figure breaks the mirror and the couple is impaled while the woman is on top of the man. The mirror goes through both of them. I also recall a scene at the beginning of the movie where the final girl has sex at night on a beach while being watched by the masked figure.

Another memorable part of the movie is the twist ending (major spoiler alert):

The final girl is biracial (half black). At the end of the movie, the killer removes his mask and it’s a white male. It turns out he’s her father. I think she set fire to the house and he dies inside of the house (not 100% sure it's been 20ish years).

I’m trying to find this movie because this one ignited my love of slasher films. I’ve seen countless ones since but never this one again.

movies,1lp8s82,There Is No Evil (2020) - amazing movie about conscripts who have to execute prisoners in Iran,"Hello fellow Redditors.

I watched There Is No Evil by the great Mohammad Rasoulof yesterday. It truly is an amazing movie with four different stories. Every story in the movie involves Iranians that are either forced or willingly execute prisoners in the name of their country Iran. The thing that stuck with me the most is the contrast from the beautiful scenery of the country and the terrible acts that these people are forced or willingly do. It truly shows how autocratic states like Iran enforce their death penalty; by making their conscripts do the deed.

There Is No Evil was filmed in secret in Iran and smuggled out like some of Rasoulof's other movies. 

Have you guys seen this movie? If not I would highly recommend it!

movies,1lp8fal,The Real story of Big Fish,"I originally watched the movie Big Fish once in theaters because I love Tim Burton movies and I loved the movie for being a fanciful stretch of reality like Edward Scissorshands.

I just watched the movie again with my wife and kids and I get a new perspective from the dad.  The stories are mostly real but they are somewhat more frightening as a real tale without the softened edges for the son.  There are major historical events in Big Fish that I think Tim Burton weaved into the story to give the son perspective without trying to scare him while the father deals with his own issues.  The stories come with real life issues like depression, cowardice, PTSD, paralysis, and risk of death.

What if your son asked you about your time in war?  A lot of people just didn't talk about it after WW2.  A lot of people went nuts after their time in Vietnam.  Here, the father gets to tell the tale of almost dying by ignoring the dark parts and violenc by emphasizing his recruitment of twins for defection for a carnival act, and managing them as he worked his way home across multiple Communist countries; rather than telling a tale about his family thinking he was dead, the hardship of war, and his desertion from the military after being a POW (the book version has the boat he was on being sank off of North Korea).

What if your son wanted to ask you about your childhood and you spent a long time paralyzed from polio hooked up to machines that pushed and pulled on your body?  You were paralyzed in youth because there were no polio vaccines before 1953 (before Korean War and up to 30 years before end of Vietnam War).  Your son was fully vaccinated and you never even told you about the scare of life with polio (heck, a lot of anti-vaxxers now grew up with vaccines and never knew what polio was).  How do you tell your child about a risk in your life that he will never have to face in his lifetime?

Every two weeks, you save for a home for your wife and kids.  You put away money for years while your wife and kids live in a trailer park.  You scrimp and save only to have it wiped away by the oil speculation crash of 1986.  Only, the stock crash isn't only affecting Texans, you go home to Alabama to find this gambling destroyed small towns like Spectre as well after Black Monday in 1987.  The father happens to know people who retained their wealth through the crash and he makes a predatory purchase on the whole town of Spectre for pennies on the dollar (via public tax auction).  Then he places it in trust so his friends can get steady payments on the city while he ""saves"" some childhood friends.  Instead of telling the son about exploiting people at their worst and taking advantage after the big banks reamed people over, the dad gets to spin it as a tale of being an accidental bank robber and advising a friend to becoming an even bigger villain in a comical way.  Additionally, he avoids telling his son that he also lost all the family money in speculation by saying a robber took his money.

Working for a circus with a homeless giant you met battling by the river has a more magical ring is just it's own thing.  The werewolf at night that rages may have been helping Danny Devito deal with his demons like alcohol abuse after hours in his trailer.

Tim Burton wrote the movie based on the book but also his own relationship with his own dad.  I think there was more real truths than lies in this story.

movies,1lp59kr,The Jurassic franchise makes me sad,"I think the first film is a masterpiece. One of Spielberg's greatest films of all time. Maybe not number 1 but top 5 if not 3. I watched it last year for the first time in years. I didn’t think it would be all that good anymore with how lifeless the series felt in the modern age. But no. It’s still an amazing movie that lives on its simplicity. Dinosaurs are brought back. At first it seems magical. Then it’s a nightmare.

And now with the seventh movie in the franchise coming out I’m feeling that same tired and apathetic feeling I felt before I re-experienced the original. This really feels like it was not meant to be a franchise. The first film is very simple and the minute you try to stretch it beyond that you lose the appeal. It’s not like Indiana Jones where you can have multiple adventures. That’s why we have Dial of Destiny a chance because a fifth movie could’ve worked. But with Jurassic I just can’t see it. 

And I feel like with how lifeless the series feels now it’s easier and easier to forget how amazing the first one actually is. Which is why I’m not even bothering to see this one. I saw some reviews of it and that was enough for me to learn this wasn’t worth my time or money. We should listen to the ending of the first one and let these creatures stay gone and not try to bring them back because it never works.

Not sure how anyone else feels about this. For anyone who has actually seen it is there actually something in Rebirth that’s worth while?  ",2428,754,1751385161.0,Discussion,0.88,True,False,PeteOfDawn,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1lp59kr/the_jurassic_franchise_makes_me_sad/,new,medium

technology,6cvg82,Comcast is trying to censor our pro-net neutrality website that calls for an investigation into fake FCC comments potentially funded by the cable lobby,"Fight for the Future has received [a cease and desist order](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ) from Comcast’s lawyers, claiming that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) - a pro-net neutrality site encouraging Internet users to investigate an astroturfing campaign possibly funded by the cable lobby - violates Comcast’s ""valuable intellectual property."" The letter threatens legal action if the domain is not transferred to Comcast’s control.

The notice is ironic, in that it’s a perfect example of why we need Title II based net neutrality protections that ban ISPs from blocking or throttling content. 

**If the FCC’s current proposal is enacted, there would be nothing preventing Comcast from simply censoring this site -- or other sites critical of their corporate policies -- without even bothering with lawyers.**

The legal notice can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BI7YZ). It claims that [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) violates the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act and infringes on Comcast’s trademarks. Of course, these claims are legally baseless, since the site is clearly a form of First Amendment protected political speech and makes no attempt to impersonate Comcast. (See the case ""[Bosley Medical Institute vs. Kremer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Medical_Institute,_Inc._v._Kremer)"" which held that a site critical of a company’s practices could not be considered trademark infringement, or the case Taubman vs. Webfeats, which decided that *sucks.com domain names—in this case taubmansucks.com—were free speech)

[Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com) criticizes the cable lobby and encourages Internet users to search the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)’s docket to check if a fake comment was submitted using their name and address to attack Title II based net neutrality protections. It has been [widely reported](https://www.bna.com/fcc-set-move-n73014451155/) that more than 450,000 of these comments have been submitted to the FCC -- and as a result of the site at [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), Fight for the Future [has heard](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-05-18-fcc-ignores-growing-evidence-of-fraud-moves-ahead/) from dozens of people who say that anti-net neutrality comments were submitted using their personal information without their permission. We have connected individuals with Attorneys Generals and have called for the FCC act immediately to investigate this potential fraud.

Companies like Comcast have a long history of funding shady astroturfing operations like the one we are trying to expose with [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and also a long history of engaging in censorship. This is exactly why we need net neutrality rules, and why we can’t trust companies like Comcast to just ""behave"" when they have abused their power time and time again.

Fight for the Future has no intention of taking down [Comcastroturf.com](http://comcastroturf.com), and we would be happy to discuss the matter with Comcast in court.

technology,6h82ji,"PornHub, OK Cupid, Imgur, DuckDuckGo, Namecheap, Bittorrent, and a bunch of other big sites have joined the Internet-Wide Day of Action for Net Neutrality on July 12 (Amazon, Kickstarter, Etsy, Mozilla, and Reddit were already on board.)","Hey reddit, I wanted to give a quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** that lots of us are planning for July 12th.

There's a huge amount of momentum. This morning PornHub (with 75 million daily visitors) [announced](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pornhub-will-show-its-75-million-daily-visitors-why-net-neutrality-matters) that they will be participating. Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 30 subreddits!

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.

technology,7779es,The FCC is expected to announce a vote to gut net neutrality rules the day before Thanksgiving. This could be the last chance for Internet users to make their voices heard.,"Hey reddit, I wanted to give everyone a heads up that Ajit Pai, former Verizon lawyer and current chairman of the FCC, is expected to circulate the text of his rule and announce a vote to gut net neutrality protections on November 22, the day before Thanksgiving.

**[That means these next few weeks could be our last chance to speak out to defend net neutrality. You can use this tool to call your lawmakers.](https://www.battleforthenet.com)**

Once the FCC announces a vote (which would likely be at its open meeting in December), it will become much, much harder to stop them from gutting the rules that prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T from charging us all extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling, blocking, and censoring websites, apps, games, and streaming services. 

The good news is that we are hearing from people who are meeting with Congress that there are key lawmakers who are sympathetic to the cause, and considering stepping in to slow down the FCC. **But they need to be getting a lot more phone calls from constituents in order to act.**

The groups behind the big Net Neutrality [day of action](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12) that happened back on July 12 are calling on all Internet users, websites, apps, subreddits, and online communities to do everything they can to drive as many phone calls to Congress as possible between now and November 22. 

**There's an easy click-to-call tool set up at https://www.battleforthenet.com**

**We have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join**

Our best shot at saving net neutrality is if we can get phones ringing off the hook in Washington, DC right NOW. It's a long shot, but it's our best shot. Please spread the word, and message me if you want to learn more or get involved.

technology,6e8wta,Eight members of Congress that voted to kill broadband privacy are now leading the charge to kill Net Neutrality as well,"FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. 
 
We can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. 
 
Here’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  
 
They’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.
 
Here are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:
 
* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)

* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)
 
All of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)
 
**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** 
 
We can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.

EDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too.

technology,867jo1,The CLOUD Act would let cops get our data directly from big tech companies like Facebook without needing a warrant. Congress just snuck it into the must-pass omnibus package.,"Congress just attached the CLOUD Act to the 2,232 page, must-pass [omnibus package](http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20180319/BILLS-115SAHR1625-RCP115-66.pdf). It's on page 2,201.

The so-called CLOUD Act would hand police departments in the U.S. and other countries new powers to directly collect data from tech companies instead of requiring them to first get a warrant. It would even let foreign governments wiretap inside the U.S. without having to comply with U.S. Wiretap Act restrictions.

Major tech companies like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Oath are [supporting](https://blogs.microsoft.com/datalaw/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2018/02/Tech-Companies-Letter-of-Support-for-Senate-CLOUD-Act-020618.pdf) the bill because it makes their lives easier by relinquishing their responsibility to protect their users’ data from cops. And they’ve been throwing their lobby power behind getting the CLOUD Act attached to the omnibus government spending bill. 

Read more about the CLOUD Act from EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/03/new-backdoor-around-fourth-amendment-cloud-act) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/cloud-act-dangerous-expansion-police-snooping-cross-border-data), and the ACLU [here](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/internet-privacy/cloud-act-dangerous-piece-legislation) and [here](https://www.aclu.org/letter/coalition-letter-cloud-act).

There's certainly MANY other bad things in this omnibus package. But don't lose sight of this one. Passing the CLOUD Act would impact all of our privacy and would have serious implications.

technology,fkzfzq,Reject the anti-encryption bill. These Senators are trying to damage privacy & security while everyone is distracted with Coronavirus! EFF made this easy tool so you can tell your senators.,"[**Link to EFF's easy tool to tell your senators.**](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

While  the media and people are distracted with COVID-19, two Senators have  been sneaking through an attack on privacy and online security.

Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be  read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle  such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d  lose  legal protections that allow them to operate.

[Take Action](https://act.eff.org/action/protect-our-speech-and-security-online-reject-the-graham-blumenthal-bill)

That’s what the Senate Judiciary Committee has proposed and hopes to pass into law. The [so-called EARN IT bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398/text), sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will [strip Section 230 protections](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/graham-blumenthal-bill-attack-online-speech-and-security)   away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,”   meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy. The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney   General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban   encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message. This is the next FOSTA - which was disaster for many users and small companies.

The EARN IT bill had  its first hearing March 12th, and its supporters’  strategy is clear. Because  they didn’t put the word “encryption” in the bill, they’re going to  insist it doesn’t affect encryption.

“This  bill says nothing about encryption,” co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal said  at today’s hearing. “Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness.

It’s  true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption.  It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by  the  Attorney General and law enforcement agencies. And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear \[[PDF](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Shehan%20Testimony.pdf)\]   what he wants the best practices to be. NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law   enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.

You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can [create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/there-no-middle-ground-encryption). The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is [just another way to break end-to-end encryption](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/11/why-adding-client-side-scanning-breaks-end-end-encryption). Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.

The  19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC. Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of   best practices. Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.

The Commission won’t be a  body that seriously considers policy; it  will be a vehicle for creating  a law enforcement wish list. Barr has  made clear, [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/doj-and-fbi-show-no-signs-correcting-past-untruths-their-new-attacks-encryption) and [over](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/12/fancy-new-terms-same-old-backdoors-encryption-debate-2019) again, that breaking encryption is at the top of that wish list. Once   it’s broken, authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as   they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not   just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those   governments want to suppress. 

The  privacy and security of all users will suffer if U.S. law  enforcement  is able to achieve its dream of breaking encryption.  Senators should  reject the EARN IT bill.

F* You Microsoft!,"##[We were asked to do an AMA about our operation here.. it's right now (starting 4:30pm EST) at this link..

## Btw, Final Win X data usage here: 17GB!  :|

Self Explanatory. Aside from the fact that we pay per MB, and already share a slow connection, if a forced upgrade happened and crashed our pc's while in the middle of coordinating rangers under fire from armed militarized poachers.. blood could literally be on MS's hands. I just came here recently to act as their pilot.. but have IT skills as well. The guy who set these pc's up didn't know how to prevent it, or set a metered connection. I am completely livid.   [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/97G7RuX)

***Edit***: **Just want to say thanks for the interest and donations!** I was just trying to blow off some steam. It's a stressful environment to be sure. And to those criticizing about the lack of proper IT staff.. There's a lot of things we could wish for. You just try to do the best you can with what's available.. this is the bush.. and it's a worthy cause.  
   
It's against the rules for me to post links here, but a mod has given permission to mention our facebook page (where you can learn more about our work and how you can support with our linked crowdfunding page). Simply search for **""Chinko Project, CAR""** in the facebook search box. Also, If you are interested in seeing more about our operation (imgur albums) check out my comment below (with proof too).. thanks alot  
   
***Edit #2***: /u/FATstuntman suggested that if we raised the money for the ultralight plane, we name it Planey McPlaneface. You're damn straight we would! :)  
   
***Final Edit***: Once the generators are turned off, the batteries to keep the internet up won't last all night. A few people have asked for an AMA.. I can speak towards bush flying in general & bush IT stuff.. but I'll get my founder to join in and answer the cooler questions about anti-poaching life & the organization. So if you're interested, we'll try to set that up for Saturday the 4th @ 11:30 EST :) thanks everyone.

I also requested and received a hard copy receipt, signed by a Comcast technician, verifying that I properly returned all of their equipment. Despite all that, I have been repeatedly billed for $360 in Unreturned Equipment fees. I have of course repeatedly and firmly disputed the fees but have not been able to get them removed.

Every single step of my Comcast Equipment Return process is well documented [HERE] (http://www.buzzfeed.com/dannfuria/definitive-proof-it-is-impossible-to-avoid-comcast-wji6) and includes yet another Comcast audio recording.

Comcast additionally slammed me with a $960 Termination Fee for closing my account.

Due to an enormity of issues with my Comcast account and customer service, I began thoroughly documenting and recording my interactions with Comcast back in January of 2014.  My Comcast story has gotten a little bit of coverage by Gawker and The Verge in the past three days.

technology,apu3oz,"With the recent Chinese company, Tencent, in the news about investing in Reddit, and possible censorship, it's amazing to me how so many people don't realize Reddit is already one of the most heavily censored websites on the internet.","I was looking through these recent /r/technology threads:

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apcmtf/reddit_users_rally_against_chinese_censorship/

https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apgfu6/winnie_the_pooh_takes_over_reddit_due_to_chinese/

And it seems that there are a lot (probably most) of people completely clueless about the widespread censorship that already occurs on reddit. And in addition, they somehow think they'll be able to tell when censorship occurs! 


&#x200B;

I [wrote about this](https://old.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/apig51/rtheoryofreddit_mods_remove_thread_and_all/) in a few different subs recently, which you can find in my submission history, but here are some main takeaways:

* Over the past 5+ years Reddit has gone from being the best site for extensive information sharing and lengthy discussion, to being one of the most censored sites on the internet, with many subs regularly secretly removing more than 40% of the content. With the Tencent investment it simply seems like censorship is officially a part of Reddit's business model. 

* A small amount of random people/mods who ""got there first"" control most of reddit. They are accountable to no one, and everyone is subject to the whims of their often capricious, self-serving, and abusive behavior. 


* Most of reddit is censored completely secretly. By default there is no notification or reason given when any content is removed. Mod teams have to make an effort to notify users and cite rules. Many/most mods do not bother with this. This can extend to bans as well, which can be done silently via automod configs. Modlogs are private by default and mod teams have to make an effort to make them public. 

* Reddit finally released the mod guidelines after years of complaints, but the admins do not enforce them. Many mods publicly boast about this fact. 

* The tools to see when censorship happens are ceddit.com, removeddit.com, revddit.com ([more info](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/apu3oz/with_the_recent_chinese_company_tencent_in_the/eq83p0a/)), and using ""open in new private window"" for all your comments and submissions. You simply replace the ""reddit.com/r/w.e"" in the address to ceddit.com/r/w.e""

/r/undelete tracks things that were removed from the front page, but most censorship occurs well before a post makes it to the front page. 

There are a number of /r/RedditAlternatives that are trying to address the issues with reddit. 

EDIT: Guess I should mention a few notables:

technology,43fi39,I set up my Raspberry Pi to automatically tweet at Comcast Xfinity whenever my internet speeds drop significantly below what I pay for,"https://twitter.com/a_comcast_user

I pay for 150mbps down and 10mbps up. The raspberry pi runs a series of speedtests every hour and stores the data. Whenever the downspeed is below 50mbps the Pi uses a twitter API to send an automatic tweet to Comcast listing the speeds. 

I know some people might say I should not be complaining about 50mpbs down, but when they advertise 150 and I get 10-30 I am unsatisfied. I am aware that the Pi that I have is limited to ~100mbps on its Ethernet port (but seems to top out at 90) so when I get 90 I assume it is also higher and possibly up to 150.

Comcast has noticed and every time I tweet they will reply asking for my account number and address...usually hours after the speeds have returned to normal values. I have chosen not to provide them my account or address because I do not want to singled out as a customer; all their customers deserve the speeds they advertise, not just the ones who are able to call them out on their BS.

The Pi also runs a website server local to our network where with a graphing library I can [see the speeds over different periods of time](http://i.imgur.com/qdnnLzg.png).



EDIT: A lot of folks have pointed out that the results are possibly skewed by our own network usage. We do not torrent in our house; we use the network to mainly stream TV services and play PC and Xbone live games. I set the speedtest and graph portion of this up (without the tweeting part) earlier last year when the service was so constatly bad that Netflix wouldn't go above 480p and I would have >500ms latencies in CSGO. I service was constantly below 10mbps down. I only added the Twitter portion of it recently and yes, admittedly the service has been better.

Plenty of the drops were during hours when we were not home or everyone was asleep, and I  am able to download steam games or stream Netflix at 1080p and still have the speedtest registers its near its maximum of ~90mbps down, so when we gets speeds on the order of 10mpbs down and we are not heavily using the internet we know the problem is not on our end.

technology,6ivklm,"Net neutrality day of action update: Twitter, Soundcloud, and Medium, have joined. Reddit, This could be as big as SOPA.","Hey reddit, I wanted to give another quick update on the **[Internet-Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)** planned for July 12th that tons of major websites, subreddits, online communities, and Internet users are helping organize.

The momentum is continuing to build. In the past few days Twitter, Soundcloud, Medium, Adblock, Twilio, and some other big names [have joined.](https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2017-06-22-net-neutrality-day-of-action-gets-another-huge/) Since we announced earlier this month a ton of other high-traffic sites have signed on including Imgur, Amazon, Namecheap, OK Cupid, Bittorrent, Mozilla, Kickstarter, Etsy, GitHub, Vimeo, Chess.com, Fark, Checkout.com, Y Combinator, and Private Internet Access. 

Reddit itself has also joined, [along with](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6g9pkl/reddit_lets_get_organized_more_than_30_subreddits/) more than 80 subreddits!

We've started solidifying ideas for the types of messages that sites can display on the day of the protest, and you can [check those out here](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/#join) (feedback is welcome!) 

EDIT: A little more info about the plan: on July 12 websites will display a prominent message on their homepage, and apps and services will send push notifications or do whatever makes the most sense for them to reach as many people as possible. We'll direct people to [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), an optimized action site that easily allows anyone to submit a comment to the FCC and Congress at the same time, make a phone call, and sign up to participate in meetings with lawmakers. We'll also have video bumpers that YouTubers and other video creators can use. Basically, everyone should think about how they can use the power of the Internet to reach their audience with a message abotu net neutrality and make it easy for them to take action.

**Important context from my previous update below.**

Net neutrality is the basic principle that prevents Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon from charging us extra fees to access the online content we want -- or throttling, blocking, and censoring websites and apps. Title II is the legal framework for net neutrality, and the FCC is trying to get rid of it, under immense pressure for the Cable lobby.

This day of action is an incredibly important moment for the Internet to come together -- across political lines -- and show that we don't want our Cable companies controlling what we can do online, or picking winners and losers when it comes to streaming services, games, and online content.

The current FCC chairman, Ajit Pai, is a former Verizon lawyer and seems intent on getting rid of net neutrality and misleading the public about it. But the FCC has to answer to Congress. If we can create another moment of massive online protest like the SOPA Blackout and the Internet Slowdown, we have a real chance of stopping the FCC in its tracks, and protecting the Internet as a free and open platform for creativity, innovation, and exchange of ideas. 

So! If you've got a website, blog, Tumblr, or any kind of social media following, or if you are a subreddit mod or active in an online community or forum, please get involved! There's so much we as redditors can do, from blacking out our sites to drive emails and phone calls to organizing in-person meetings with our lawmakers. Feel free to message me directly or email team (at) fightforthefuture (dot) org to get involved, and **[learn more here.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT:** Oh hai, everyone! Very glad you're here. Lots of awesome brainstorming happening in the comments. Keep it coming. A lot of people are asking what sites will be doing on July 12. We're still encouraging brainstorming and creativity, but the basic idea is that sites will have a few options of things they can do to their homepage to show what the web would be like without net neutrality, ie a slow loading icon to show they are stuck in the slow lane, a ""site blocked"" message to show they could be censored, or an ""upgrade your Internet service to access this site"" fake paywall to show how we could be charged special fees to access content. Love all your ideas! Keep sharing, and **[go here for more info about the protest.](https://www.battleforthenet.com/july12)**

**EDIT 2:** It's worth noting that given the current chairman of the FCC's political orientation, it's extra important that conservatives, libertarians, and others to the right of center speak out on this issue. The cable lobby is working super hard to turn this technological issue into a partisan circus. We can't let them. Net neutrality protects free speech, free markets, innovation, and economic opportunity. We need people and sites from all across the political spectrum to be part of this.

**During the six month period from mid-January of 2014 through the end of July of 2014, I had to contact Comcast an astounding 25 times in regards to a multitude of issues, errors, and mistakes with my service, and charges related to my Comcast account.**  I kept careful, written records of my experiences as far back as January of this year, and by early July I had experienced such a stupefying range of problems with Comcast, that I additionally began recording my interactions with them.

During the above-referenced six month period, Comcast was a thoroughly disconcerting 0 for 25 in resolving anything.  Now, I completely understand that it may seem rather farfetched for me to claim that a single company (even one as notorious as Comcast) could fail the same customer 25 consecutive times, that is until you consider that I have previously documented at length each of [25 Consecutive Failed Comcast Interactions here in a four page Comcast blog] (http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast) spanning 6 months, 17 phone calls, 6 appointments, 2 online interactions, 20+ hours of my personal time, and $1320 in fees) and further that I possess months of paperwork, 50+ pages of documents, files, images, bills, screen shots, phone records, and roughly two hours of audio recordings, to support my claims.  While my four page Comcast blog may not be the most exhilarating read, the entirety of the account - the sum of its parts, if you will - is in my opinion a damning indictment of Comcast customer handling.  At a minimum, my four page Comcast blog provides another well documented account of a relentlessly awful brand of service.


**Part 2 - COMCAST’S RESPONSE TO MY FRONT PAGE REDDIT POST ABOUT COMCAST’S NOTORIOUS FEES**

As noted above, I tried in earnest 25 times in a six month period from January through July of 2014 to get Comcast to help me.  Comcast steadfastly ignored, neglected, dodged, and billed the crap out of me.  Put more poignantly, Comcast played an incredibly effective game of “Annoying you out of your money, wearing you down until you're too weak to complain, and then when you just can't go on, charge you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices."" (Bill Maher, 7/25/14).

Then, *after* my [Comcast’s Notorious Unreturned Equipment Fees]( http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/) post topped the Reddit front page four days ago and my story received national attention, Comcast’s Corporate office left me 5 messages in 18 hours.  I repeat - not a SINGLE Comcast employee could bother to help me one time in 6 months, despite my 25 well documented attempts to get help, and now all of the sudden Comcast has the ability to contact me 5 times in 18 hours?  That is interesting.

When I listened to the first voicemail from Comcast Corporate, I felt relieved that someone might actually finally help me.  But by the time I made my way through five consecutive Comcast Corporate messages (4 of them from the same person), and realized that they had all been delivered in an 18 hour period directly after my “Comcast fees” post went Reddit-viral, I literally began to feel sick to my stomach by Comcast’s response.  Now, I understand that when a Comcast customer story like mine starts to get national attention, Comcast probably tries to minimize whatever gripes might publicly emerge.  I also concede – flat out – a measure of hypocrisy on my part for reacting partly in anger that Comcast finally responded to me.  Having said that, there could not possibly be a more poignant, scathing illustration of the contrast between Comcast’s treatment of a regular customer (contemptuously disregarded 25 times in 6 months) and a “Special / Going Public” customer (5 Corporate messages in 18 hours).

All indications are that Comcast has just now (as of about 3 days ago) taken notice of a customer - who for several years has resided in their backyard, the suburbs of Philadelphia – and begun to address but one of many unfortunate aspects of my Comcast experience (the $1320 in fees aspect).  I, meanwhile, have had 7 months to bake in the rancor of Comcast Purgatory, a dimension from which very few, if any, escape.  So please allow me, indulge me if you would be so kind, to summarize how this feels from my perspective:  In a six month period this year, Comcast mishandled my account 25 times in a row, put me on hold on the phone for several hours, failed to show up to multiple appointments, hung up on me while I was on hold, fed me a torrent of misinformation (much of which is recorded on audio, mine and theirs), threatened me with and then auto-generated to my account a Literally-Unremovable $960 Termination Fee, repeatedly billed me $360 for properly returning my equipment, and wasted way more than 20 hours of my time.

Comcast’s effective response in helping me during the six month time frame? Zero. Zilch. None. Null. Devoid.
Comcast’s response when I cancelled my account?  They buried me $1320 in fees.
Comcast’s response when I went public to complain?  Their Corporate office immediately contacted me 5 times in 18 hours.

**And so this appears to be the standard for receiving attention from a Comcast representative who actually has the ability or power to address problems that Comcast has caused a customer:** First, a customer should suffer through months of negligence and poor treatment, documenting each step of the journey while firmly battling a motley assortment of heinous fees, then after 6 months utterly give up all hope and feel like a fool for bothering to try so hard to get Comcast to help you, then – if you can manage to find the time - write a [4 page blog about your Comcast experience](http://www.dannfuria.com/comcast), then [share part of your story with Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2dibwq/in_order_to_avoid_comcasts_notorious_unreturned/), be fortunate enough to receive incredible & overwhelming support that vaults your post to the Reddit front page, and gain some national coverage (from The Verge, Gawker, & International Business Times).  Perhaps then - and only then - can a customer get Comcast to clean up a mess they’ve created.

It appears, for the time being, that I might just escape from Comcastic Purgatory.

science,7e1jo1,Raising the taxes of graduate students by as much as 300% will be a disaster for the USA,"Science and technology development has been the story of the past 100 years.  The discoveries and innovations are progressing at a dazzling rate, much of this lead by researchers at universities in the USA.  At these universities, a substantial amount of the work is done by graduate students, who work long hours (80 hours weeks aren't unusual) for little pay.  These graduate students go on to work in good paying jobs, where their innovations make more jobs for others.  


Start-ups develop to bring new innovations based on the skills graduate students learn (Google was the project of a couple of Stanford grad students, even Reddit benefited from the skills of a physics grad student/PhD, /u/keysersosa, the current CTO.)  Grad school has been for decades a path to prosperity for  those who come from humble beginnings but are willing to work hard, and make sacrifices, a system that has greatly benefited all of us.


This is why we scientists are shocked and appalled by the recently passed tax bill in congress which will result in the tax bills of already poor grad students [going up by as much as 300%](http://fortune.com/2017/11/08/graduate-students-say-gop-tax-plan-could-increase-their-taxes-by-nearly-300/), which would see their take-home pay drop by 25%. As a former grad student myself, I can tell you that I would not have been able to continue if my pay had be reduced by $7,000, and many students would make the same conclusion.  Instead, some will not go into science or they will leave the USA to be a grad student in Europe or Asia, most of these students will never return to the USA. 


This is why every major science organization has [voiced opposition to the current tax plan](https://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS%20Multisociety%20Letter%20on%20Tax%20Reform.pdf?D1fnCM0H.C.qegz_Yo2wJwPV7IWBzuGy), make no mistake, this plan will [undermine research and eventually the economy of the USA](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-017-05925-6).

In comic form from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1985).


What can we do to stop it?  Call your representatives in congress and let them know.  It hasn't passed yet, but it's about to.  If we don't raise voices now, we will all regret it.

I'm part of a campaign enabled by Nokia and hope you will join the conversation on http://www.wired.com/maketechhuman. Learn more about my foundation here: http://stephenhawkingfoundation.org/ 
 

Due to the fact that I will be answering questions at my own pace, working with the moderators of /r/Science we are opening this thread up in advance to gather your questions. 
 

My goal will be to answer as many of the questions you submit as possible over the coming weeks. I appreciate all of your understanding, and taking the time to ask me your questions.


**Moderator Note**

This AMA will be run differently due to the constraints of Professor Hawking.  The AMA will be in two parts, today we with gather questions.  Please post your questions and vote on your favorite questions, from these questions Professor Hawking will select which ones he feels he can give answers to.  

Once the answers have been written, we, the mods, will cut and paste the answers into this AMA and post a link to the AMA in /r/science so that people can re-visit the AMA and read his answers in the proper context.  The date for this is undecided, as it depends on several factors.  

Professor Hawking is a guest of /r/science and has volunteered to answer questions; please treat him with due respect. **Comment rules will be strictly enforced, and uncivil or rude behavior will result in a loss of privileges in /r/science.**

Trump for Incitement of Insurrection. The vote saw 10 Republican members of Congress vote in favor of impeachment, along with all 222 Democrats. 

This is the first time that a US President has been impeached twice during their presidency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that he does not plan on reconvening the Senate prior to January 19th, making it likely that the impeachment trial will take place during the beginning of President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s administration.

politics,i4ulnr,[Megathread] NY Attorney General Moves to Dissolve the NRA After Fraud Investigation,"The Attorney General of New York took action today to dissolve the National Rifle Association, following an 18-month investigation that found evidence the powerful gun rights group is ""fraught with fraud and abuse.""

Attorney General Letitia James claims in a lawsuit filed Thursday that she found financial misconduct in the millions of dollars, and that it contributed to a loss of more than $64 million over a three year period.

The state's top prosecutor said the organization engaged in illegal conduct by diverting ""millions of dollars away from the charitable mission of the organization for personal use by senior leadership, awarding contracts to the financial gain of close associates and family, and appearing to dole out lucrative no-show contracts to former employees in order to buy their silence and continued loyalty.

politics,j7gppm,Megathread: FBI Announces They’ve Foiled a Plot to Kidnap Michigan Governor Whitmer,"Six men were arrested and accused of plotting with a militia group to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, the authorities said.

The men had been discussing taking Gov. Whitmer, a Democrat, hostage since at least the summer, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court and unsealed on Thursday.

Several of the men had discussed creating a society in which they could be ""self-sufficient"" and one said he needed 200 men to storm the Statehouse in Lansing, Mich.""

Architect of the legal fight for women’s rights in the 1970s, Ginsburg subsequently served 27 years on the nation’s highest court, becoming its most prominent member. Her death will inevitably set in motion what promises to be a nasty and tumultuous political battle over who will succeed her, and it thrusts the Supreme Court vacancy into the spotlight of the presidential campaign.

politics,dejfnt,Megathread: Federal Judge Rules President Trump Must Turn Over Eight Years Of Personal And Corporate Tax Returns,"A federal judge on Monday rejected a bold argument from President Trump that sitting presidents are immune from criminal investigations, allowing the Manhattan district attorney’s office to subpoena eight years of the president’s personal and corporate tax returns.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump were expected to appeal the ruling from Judge Victor Marrero of Manhattan federal court. The president’s could not immediately be reached for comment.

In a 75-page ruling, Judge Marrero said called president’s argument ""repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values."" Presidents, their families and businesses are not above the law, the judge ruled.

In response, the President's lawyers filed an emergency notice of appeal to the 2nd circuit. 


## UPDATE:

The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has granted Donald Trump a temporary administrative stay pending expedited review by a panel of the Court.

politics,eizr6l,"Susan Collins has failed the people of Maine and this country. She has voted to confirm Trump’s judicial nominees, approve tax cuts for the rich, and has repeatedly chosen to put party before people. I am running to send her packing. I’m Betsy Sweet, and I am running for U.S. Senate in Maine. AMA.","Thank you so much for your thoughtful questions! As usual, I would always rather stay and spend my time connecting with you here, however, my campaign manager is telling me it's time to do other things. Please check out my website and social media pages, I look forward to talking with you there!

I am a life-long activist, political organizer, small business owner and mother living in Hallowell, Maine. I am a progressive Democrat running for U.S. Senate, seeking to unseat Republican incumbent Susan Collins. 

Mainers and all Americans deserve leaders who will put people before party and profit. I am not taking a dime of corporate or dark money during this campaign. I will be beholden to you. 

I support a Green New Deal, Medicare for All and eliminating student debt. 

As the granddaughter of a lobsterman, the daughter of a middle school math teacher and a foodservice manager, and a single mom of three, I know the challenges of working-class Mainers firsthand.

I also have more professional experience than any other candidate in this Democratic primary. 

I helped create the first Clean Elections System in the country right here in Maine because I saw the corrupting influence of money in politics and policymaking and decided to do something about it. I ran as a Clean Elections candidate for governor in 2018 -- the only Democratic candidate in the race to do so. I have pledged to refuse all corporate PAC and dirty money in this race, and I fuel my campaign with small-dollar donations and a growing grassroots network of everyday Mainers. 

My nearly 40 years of advocacy accomplishments include:

* Writing and helping pass the first Family Medical Leave Act in the country

* Creating the first Clean Elections system in the country

* Working on every Maine State Budget for 37 years

* Serving as executive director of the Maine Women’s Lobby

* Serving as program coordinator for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom

* Serving as Commissioner for Women under Governors Brennan and McKernan

* Co-founding the Maine Center for Economic Policy and the Dirigo Alliance
Founding and running my own small advocacy business, Moose Ridge Associates.

* Co-founding the Civil Rights Team Project, an anti-bullying program currently taught in 400 schools across the state. 

* I am also a trainer of sexual harassment prevention for businesses, agencies and schools. 

I am proud to have the endorsements of Justice Democrats, Brand New Congress, Democracy For America, Progressive Democrats for America, Women for Justice - Northeast, Blue America and Forward Thinking Democracy.

Trump said on Monday that the F.B.I. had searched his Palm Beach, Fla., home and had broken open a safe — an account that, if accurate, would be a dramatic escalation in the various investigations into the former president. The search, according to two people familiar with the investigation, appeared to be focused on material that Mr. Trump had brought with him to Mar-a-Lago, his private club and residence, after he left the White House. Those boxes contained many pages of classified documents, according to a person familiar with their contents. The discovery of classified information at Mar-a-Lago was referred to the Justice Department by the National Archives and Records Administration, which said it had found classified material in 15 boxes at the residence.

That is all bad, but EA have just totally taken the piss with abusing Star Wars fans and cutting their games into little pieces and bleeding the fan base dry. 

I've had enough. 

#boycottswbf2

#boycottea

Edit 1: Spelt Rey wrong sorry! Autocorrect and I didn't check.

Edit 2: Thank you so very much for the support that this post has received, it really has been quite overwhelming. This post is very much a quick outpouring of thoughts of mine rather then a well thought through argument focusing on the main issues with EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2. I only eluded to the main issues, rather than outright stating the unacceptable issues with loot boxes, progression grind, the pay to win aspects and the short campaign etc. However people who are on this sub reddit are very much aware of the main issues.

All I hope that this post has managed to bring attention to the main issues and bring about some positive change.

gaming,8swmb2,"Youtuber ""Potates"" completely plagiarized a post I made on r/Fallout about Fallout 76, and passed it off as his own work. The video is now at 800k views.","EDIT 5: Just wanted to thank everybody for their interest in this topic and in me as a content creator. Now that things are cooling off, I will make an update thread a few days from now to let everybody know how things have turned out. 

There are also hundreds of people encouraging me to make a YouTube channel and I just wanted to acknowledge that. I really appreciate your interest and may set something up, but I don't have anything at this moment to share.

Thanks everybody for their kind words and support. :)

I'm not sure why this thread was locked, I didn't get a message from the mods about it. I assume just because the thread has run its course, and I'm okay with that.

**EDIT 2:**

I had no idea that this thread would blow up in the way that it has -- I only posted here to begin with because a buddy of mine posts here and he said it would be good to share, and maybe get some exposure for the original post. I am pretty overwhelmed with the amount of people who are taking an interest in this and I want to make it abundantly clear that I do not and will not ever support anybody who is dishing out threats and personal attacks against Potates. Be better than that. Thanks.

Potates has DM'd be acknowledging the situation and owning up to it, and does not deserve to be harassed and threatened over this. He has been cool about the whole situation and I am willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, and be cool back. Neither he nor I knew just how crazy this situation was going to get. Again, I am asking you from the bottom of my heart, do not lash out at Potates. Do not harass him, do not harass his family. These actions are 100% wrong and I condemn them wholeheartedly. Calling him out for his behavior is one thing, but when you cross the line into his real life, you have gone too far and need to reexamine your moral compass.

**EDIT 4:**

I am aware that Potates has removed all his videos except for his apology. I am not responsible for this, and I have not filed any kind of DMCA claim against him as we are settling things privately. I have and will continue to encourage him to not delete his YouTube channel, as I believe he can and will bounce back from this controversy. Plagiarism is serious, and there is a lesson here to be learned -- if he respects the content of *all* creators moving forward, then his channel can become a positive part of YouTube again.

It is easy to be angry at this situation, believe me. But I am always willing to give somebody another chance if they are prepared to make a genuine change, and for now, I am willing to give that chance and let things play out.

-------------------

Link to the Potates video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t26s5aMSBWY

Link to my post, which he reads (mostly) verbatim off in his video without any credit to me, or even that it is a post from reddit, whatsoever: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/8qsx8s/complete_notes_from_the_noclip_documentary/

\^That's a massive Fallout 76 info dump based on the Noclip documentary that had a strong community reaction, and got passed around a lot. It took me a while to write up as I watched the documentary, and I spent a non-trivial amount of time making as it clear and concise as possible, using direct quotes whenever possible. Shout out to when he misread one of my points that said camps are saved as blueprints, and accidentally said ""served as blueprints"" which is a nonsensical statement.

I'm passionate about video games, and love to write about them, even though I'm not a professional. So to see something you've written being plagiarized after putting in time and effort to share that written content with people just hurts a little bit. When you're looking for more opportunities to write in a way that will attract attention, seeing somebody else take that attention can really suck.

He starts his video off at the ""Gameplay"" section of my post, and at the beginning switches up his verbiage a little bit so it's not too obvious. As the video goes on, that stops quickly, and he starts reading every single bullet point almost verbatim. I'm not *too* upset because I'm glad more people got to see the information, but I am a little irritated that he passes it off as his own work. He reads the post like it was his script! Even the way he does the voice over makes it sound as if he is saying these things off the cuff, when in reality he is reading off the words I wrote from a page.  I only found this video at all because I clicked it and wanted to hear new Fallout 76 information -- a minute or two in, I realized that I had heard those words before... because I wrote them!

Here's the thing. If he had shot me a message saying ""hey man, I'd like to quote this post in a video"", I'd have said go for it 100%. If at the beginning of the video he had said something like ""hey guys I found this post on reddit I'd like to read you"", I'd be fine with that. But the fact that he passes this off as if he wrote it all, or as if he took the time to compile this information is definitely frustrating to me. I feel like I put in the work for this, and then this guy turned around and monetized it without even having the decency to acknowledge that it wasn't his. 




EDIT: I see a lot of you commenting on the video saying that he has stolen my content. Unfortunately, it appears as if he is deleting all of those comments as they come in.

**EDIT 3:***

~~I tried to comment on Potates' apology video, but the comments aren't going through. Here is what I wrote, if I am able to post it directly on the video I will do so in the morning.~~ **EDIT 5:** It appears as if the apology video has been deleted.

> Hey, I'm _Robbie. First off, I would like to lead with the fact that I completely condemn anybody who is issuing any kind of threats to @Potates and his family. Nobody deserves to be threatened and harassed over a situation like this. 

> Secondly, I would encourage @Potates not to delete his YouTube channel. I do not agree that there is no coming back from this. Mistakes were made, feathers were ruffled, and lessons were learned. I have seen smaller YouTube channels come back from worse. I have given Potates full permission to re-post the offending video under the agreement that I am properly credited, and that we can work out our differences in private. I truly believe in the value of giving somebody another chance, and even in spite of everything, I am willing to give Potates another chance.

> This whole situation got out of hand to a degree that nobody could have predicted.  Me and Potates are making things right between us in private as I type this and I am confident that we will come to an understanding.

gaming,7cx0ga,A message to those calling EA for a refund: be nice to the people taking your calls.,"Let's face it, this debacle with EA is terrible.  It's shady.  It is, according to the internet, worth hundreds of thousands of downvotes.  And now, on top of everything, if you want to remedy the situation you are forced to sit in an exaggerated phone line.

But keep in mind, the people taking your call at EA are having a much worse day than you!  These people are not the CEO, they're not the game designers, and they may not even be located in the same building as these people.  They are just trying to do their job, and it just so happens that they work at a company currently undergoing a pseudo scandal.

So be kind to them.  Because at the end of the day, they probably hate EA right now too.


Edit 1: Thank you, kind Redditor, for the Gold!  And thank you to the community for supporting the idea of showing kindness to others!

Edit 2: Thank you to the other four Gold-givers as well!  We almost hit #1 on the front page, but I think we topped out at #2.  I'm happy to see that a positive post was able to reach so high in the midst of this event!

Edit 3: I'd like to extend (likely) one last thank you to the Redditor who awarded this post its sixth gold, and to the community that actually took this post to #1 on the main page.  The Reddit community never ceases to amaze me, and I'm glad everyone could agree to support the idea of promoting human kindness.

movies,ha4t7t,"Adam Sandler said he would make a terrible film if he didn't win a Best Actor Academy Award for Uncut Gems. To help him out, I analyzed his films and their movie posters to come up with a perfectly bad Sandler film entitled 'Jacked Up'","Earlier in the year, Adam Sandler was a guest on Howard Stern’s show to discuss his starring role in the excellent *Uncut Gems*. During the interview, Sandler made a joke about what would happen if he didn’t win the Best Actor Academy Award. [He told Howard](https://www.businessinsider.com/adam-sandler-threatened-to-make-bad-movie-if-he-doesnt-win-oscar-uncut-gems-2019-12):

“If I don’t get it, I’m going to f–king come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.”

In a bad news, bad news situation, Sandler wasn’t nominated, and he’s promised to make a terrible film (I’ll still watch it a few times regardless). In an effort to assist the Sandman with his terrible film, I dug through all of his films and analyzed their posters to come up with the objectively worst Sandler picture that could be made. Here it is:

* *Jacked Up*
* Directed by Dennis Dugan
* Written By - Tim Herlihy
* PG-13
* Running Time: 135 minutes
* Released on Netflix
* Predicted Tomatometer score - 6%
* Predicted IMDb score - 3.75

Adam Sandler plays a personal trainer/shoe salesman named Jack Goodheart who is married to Janet Goodheart (Also, Sandler, using a very off-putting voice). They travel to an exclusive resort in Costa Rica to attend his 30th high school anniversary during the fourth of July weekend. During the event, Rob Schneider (playing a terrorist) and his team of henchmen, hijack the event and take everyone hostage, including State Senator Chuck Finley (Terry Crews) and presidential candidate Casey Fitzpatrick (Maya Rudolph). During the melee, Jack and Janet escape, and the two use their past military experience and buff physiques to save the day. This PG-13 action-comedy is entitled “*Jacked Up*” and ends with a jet ski chase at the hotel’s lazy river pool that circles the hotel. The film is directed by Dennis Dugan, and co-stars Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Salma Hayek, Terry Crews, Steve Buscemi, Taylor Lautner, Luke Wilson, Peter Dinklage, Maya Rudolph, and Al Pacino.

[Another very fun poster!](https://imgur.com/a/k1X5rUq)

This is how I came up with the storyline. I pulled together his best and worst films to find patterns that appear. Here are Sandler's lowest rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. I drew a lot of inspiration from them. Also, I tried to make this as objective as possible.

* *The Ridiculous 6  (0% TM)* \- Action Comedy  - Action hero
* *Jack and Jill (3% - 3.3 IMDb)* \- Two Sandler's - Jet Ski scene - Married - Holiday
* *Grown Ups 2* (7%) - Reunited with old friends - Married
* *Bulletproof* (8%) - Action comedy
* *The Cobbler* (9%) - Shoe repairman
* *The Do-Over (10%)*  \- Action Comedy - Reunited with old friend - Married
* *Grown Ups (10%)* \- Reunited with old friends - Holiday - Married
* *Adam Sandler’s Eight Crazy Nights (12%)*\- Takes place during a holiday
* *Blended* (14%) - He’s a dad who travels to Africa
* *Going Overboard* (1.8 IMDb) - Lots of terrible boat action
* *The Week Of* (5.1 IMDb) families get together for a wedding
* *Sandy Wexler (5.1 IMDb)* \- Sandler pulls a unique voice (which isn’t statistically a good thing

**Here’s all I research I compiled to create** ***Jacked Up***

* A trademark of Sandler’s latest movies is that he likes to travel to beautiful locations to film (which is brilliant, and why not?). *The Do-Over, Just Go With It, Blended*, *Grown Ups 1 & 2* and *Murder Mystery* are examples of his penchant for travel. The problem is, the films have a lower Tomatometer average (21.2%) than the films where he didn’t travel to nice locations (37.4%). This is why he travels in *Jacked Up*.
* Sandler has several directors that he enjoys working with. Those Directors are Steven Brill, Dennis Dugan and Frank Coraci. Steven Brill (20%) has a lower Tomatometer average than Dennis Dugan (24%) and Frank Coraci (30%). However, Dugan is responsible for *Jack & Jill*, so I’m giving him the director’s chair. He did direct *Happy Gilmore*, so this could backfire on me. Frank Coraci directed *The Ridiculous 6*, but, [I love the baseball scene ](https://youtu.be/sI6LvdaozEk)and he also directed *The Waterboy* and *The Wedding Singer.*
* Aside from *You Don’t Mess With the Zohan* ([which is brilliant, and has a fun jet ski action scene](https://youtu.be/5OfAMHeIr7k)), His action comedies are lackluster. *Bulletproof* (8%) and *The Do-Over (9%)* didn’t win him many points. That’s why *Jacked Up* features an action-centered plot.
* His films featuring him as a married man have a 29% Tomatometer average. Movies featuring him as a single man have a 38% Average. Thus, the marriage to himself (think *Jack & Jill*) is included. It’s a double whammy
* I picked Tim Herlihy to write because he wrote *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups 2* and *Pixels (8% average)*. I do love his *Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer* and *The Waterboy* scripts though
* His PG-13 (29%) rated films have a lower Tomatometer average than his R (51%) and PG-rated (45%) films. For Netflix, M rating = R and TV-14 = PG-13
* I included a pool because in [*Airheads* he is a pool cleaner who thinks about swimming pools](https://youtu.be/YryTJKsn2i0). Also, *Grown Ups, The Do-Over, Jack and Jill* feature swimming pools. They have low scores.
* Movies that feature Sandler doing a voice have a lower Tomatometer score (24.8%) than his regular voiced roles (36%).
* None of his Fresh films feature a jet ski -[ *50 first Dates*](https://youtu.be/S__SZwFn0Rw) *(45%),* [*Jack & Jill*](https://youtu.be/leAGt-vpIf0) *(3%)* and *You Don’t Mess with the Zohan (37%)* are all Rotten
* In *The Ridiculous Six, Grown Ups, The Do-Over*, and *Bulletproof* he plays a totally capable man who isn’t an underdog like he is in *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore*. So, he can’t be a doofus during the action scenes.
* Randomly enough, Rob Schneider shouldn’t adopt some kind of stereotyped character because his makeup-less roles have a lower Tomatometer average (27.6%) than his stereotyped roles (32%).
* His lowest rated movies on IMDb are *Going Overboard* (1.5), *Jack & Jill* (3.3), *The Ridiculous 6* (4.8), *Sandy Wexler* (5.1) and *The Week Of* (5.1) - These movies feature water exploits, gun fights, weird voices, two Sandlers, and large gatherings. These things are all in *Jacked Up*.
* \*Bulletproof (\*$25 million), *Little Nicky* ($39 million) and *Blended* ($46 million) are a few of his lowest grossing comedies. In these films, he uses a wild voice, goes on vacations and engages in action shenanigans. I left out movies like *Spanglish* and *Reign Over Me* because they aren’t traditional Sandler comedies. Also, *Billy Madison* and *Happy Gilmore* weren’t huge earners. However, they established him as a force of nature.
* His first or last name couldn’t begin with an “R” -  Howard Ratner (*Uncut Gems*), Henry Roth (*50 First Dates*), Robbie Hart (*The Wedding Singer*).

**WHAT DOES THE POSTER NEED TO LOOK LIKE?**

* He cannot be centered on the poster. His best films *Punch Drunk Love, Happy Gilmore, Funny People* and *Uncut Gems* feature him centered on the poster. *The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me* and *The Meyerowitz Stories* don’t have him centered. However, the movie posters that have centered have a 48% Tomatometer Average. The Posters that have him on the left have a 30% Tomatometer average. I’m going with that.

https://preview.redd.it/actfhq081a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9c8031c0894460b3d33ee218f96d31e80abcd3df

He' rarely centered in his ""worst"" films

https://preview.redd.it/7592qqi41a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff647a066806a5dfbf516fd83ebff761d79621dc

* There needs to be multiple people on the poster. When Sandler is alone on a poster, his movies have a 42% Tomatometer average. The movie posters with 4+ people have a 20% Tomatometer average. More is good.
* In this poster he needs to be holding something random. In *The Cobbler* poster he is holding a coffee cup (this is important) and the movie has an 8% Tomatometer score. In *The Wedding Singer* (microphone) and *Happy Gilmore* (golf club) and *The Waterboy* (bucket, helmet) he is holding items related to his character. He needs to be holding something weird (like a can of sponsored coca-cola). Also, the posters that feature him holding an item (31%) have a lower Tomatometer score than the posters featuring him not holding anything (42%).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l6mzirud1a551.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d8ccf8ee14641d421c38e2c0775f00299e517d83

* It’s best if his entire body is on the poster. The movie posters featuring a full-bodied Adam Sandler have a lower Tomatometer average (31%) than his partial body posters (43%).
* Ideally, the title would be in the center, because *Jack & Jill* and *The Ridiculous Six* have somewhat centered titles.

**Poster**

* Title centered
* Sandler(s) on left side - Full body
* At least six other characters on the poster

There you have it! I can't wait to watch *Jacked Up*.

those are two huge action movies and they are both being praised. Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.

EDIT: since a lot of people are telling me ""just watch it in 2D then, no one is forcing you"" I live in germany and the theatre that I go to ( which i own a membercard to ) has all the showings in 3D until 2-3 weeks after the movie came out. maybe it will have a 2D showing once per day, but that will be like at noon on a monday or something.

In fact, I frequently skip over titles (including, of course, a lot of Netflix original content) simply because I don’t want it to come blaring through my screen and speakers before I’m done perusing.
I don’t even see why this is an option. Nobody wants this.
Stop.

movies,azonzz,"[OPINION] Rich filmmakers who probably haven't paid money to go see a film in a regular modern cinema in years/decades need to stop running their mouths about ""the sanctity of the movie theater experience"" and admonishing home viewing, which is often a far purer film experience these days.","Rant forthcoming...  


No shortage of recent examples, the most prominent obviously being Spielberg's alleged attempts to get made-for-streaming films banned from the Oscars.  


To be clear right off the bat - **I love the cinema experience**. Or rather, the *ideal* cinema experience. But that's become *so rare* as to be a complete gamble these days, and very often ends up being the *shitty* cinema experience. Whereas I can watch a movie at home and *know* it's not going to get diminished or outright ruined by any number of constant social or technical problems.  


Do any of the free premieres and private screenings Spielberg attends include people browsing Instagram on their blinding white phones every 20 minutes, or unchecked kids talking or crying? Has he dealt with people constantly getting up and walking through your FOV to go to the bathroom or get snacks at *inexplicable* times during a film, breaking your immersion? Or not being able to afford to see more than one film every month or two due to increasingly ridiculous costs?  


There's also the technical issues which have become outright depressing now. 3D looks *terrible* compared to Blu-Ray - dark, blurry, thoroughly diluting of anything the cinematographer was trying to accomplish - but is often the only option available to see something depending on where you live. There are films I don't even feel like I've *seen* until watching them properly at home, because the 3D muddled things so badly. Sound has also become an issue - contrary to the idea that a home audio setup can never compete with the cinema, I've found that theater sound is absolutely pathetic these days compared to watching Netflix with a good pair of headphones, and am often straining to hear dialogue and am utterly unmoved by the weak music. The only consistent exception there is IMAX and UltraAVX which is gloriously loud, but that can be a problem too if it's, for example, a Nolan film, who for all his big talk about the theater experience is one of of the worst offenders for ruining it with his infamously shrill mixing that leaves viewers covering their ears, only able to enjoy his work in a controlled environment months later at home.  


The ""movie theater experience"" is great when it's the good version - nobody on their phones, nobody misbehaving, perfect picture and audio, within your budget, a whole audience communally having a great time being immersed in a film together. In practice however, this perfect storm of awesome happens maybe one in five times by my reckoning these days, and more often than not it's way more immersive, impressive and pure to watch a film on an HD screen with headphones, no distractions and privacy at home. So the Hollywood elite needs a reality check about the evils of watching their films on the small screen - it's often the only way to really appreciate them now.",62214,4491,1552276744.0,,0.77,True,False,__secter_,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/azonzz/opinion_rich_filmmakers_who_probably_havent_paid/,top,high

movies,a68vzl,"If Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in Passengers had switched roles with Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne in Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, both movies would've been significantly better.","In Valerian you could have Chris Pratt as the handsome and cocky Special Operative with his sexy, ass-kicking co-pilot in Lawrence.  They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get.   It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline.   
  
On the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger.  Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him.    
  
I think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat?  It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling.     
  
I also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that **I** wanted it to be).  Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker:     
  
Keep it mostly the same through the first two acts.  Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane.  Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship.  She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted.  Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on.  That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship.  You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.

movies,cahtb1,"Opinion: I think it was foolish of Disney to remake so many of their popular movies within the span of a year: Dumbo, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan. If they had spaced them out to maybe 1 or 2 a year, they might each be received better; but now people are getting weary, and Disney's greed is showing.","I know their executives are under pressure to perform, but that's the problem when capitalism overrides common sense in entertainment; they want to make the most money for the quarterly/yearly record-books and don't always consider the long-term.  IMO each of the films in the Disney Renaissance years could have pulled them a lot of money if they had released them over the course of a few years.  Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.  But if Disney forces its supply on movie goers, they might just find people balking at its oversaturation of the market and so may rebel in their entertainment choices some way, reflecting in lower revenue for Disney.  As it's said in Spiderman, ""with great power comes great responsibility;"" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it.",59725,4437,1562569766.0,,0.82,True,False,GoRush87,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/cahtb1/opinion_i_think_it_was_foolish_of_disney_to/,top,high

movies,wppvvg,"Please Netflix, I beg of you; let the credits roll.","I've just finished Gladiator. The music swells as the camera pans above the colosseum. The emotions that come from a triumphant yet bittersweet ending begin to settle. And as the screen fades to black, and you feel the catharsis that comes from watching an epic film take hold....

A bright title card for Suits comes up.

Who has ever finished a film and on finishing it clicks the recommended film straight away?  And yet the ads come up, every single time. It completely ruins the moment. And yes, you can click the box to continue watching the credits- but why should we even have to do that? Why is it so hard for Netflix to not promote their material for five minutes after a film ends?

In a life bombarded by advertisements do we have to be shown another one the second a film finishes? Is there no respite? 

From what I've seen online there isn't a way to disable this specific feature (though I would really love to be proven wrong on this one).

movies,45sul3,"Okay Hollywood, ""Deadpool"" and ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"" are both smash hits at the box office. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" is even nominated for best picture. So, can we PLEASE go back to having R rated blockbusters?","I think /r/movies can be a bit too obsessed with things being rated R but overall, I still agree with the sentiment. Terminator 2 could not be made today and I think that's very sad because many people consider it one of the best movies of all time. 

The common counter-argument to this is something along the lines of ""swearing, blood, and nudity aren't what makes a movie good"". And that would be correct, something being rated R does not inherently make it good or better. But what it DOES add is realism. REAL people swear. Real people bleed. Real people have nipples. R ratings are better for making things feel realistic and grounded. 

Also, and I think this is an even important point, PG-13 often makes the audience feel a bit too comfortable. Sometimes art should be boundary pushing or disturbing. Some movies need to be graphic in order to really leave a lasting mark. I think this is the main problem with audiences and movies today, a lot of it is too safe and comfortable. I rarely feel any great sense of emotion. Do you think the T-1000 would have been as iconic of a movie villain if we hadn't seen him stab people through the head with his finger? Probably not. In Robocop, would Murphy's near-death experience have felt as intense had it cut away and not shown him getting filled with lead? Definitely not. Sometimes you NEED that.

I'm not saying everything has to be R. James Bond doesn't have to be R because since day one his movies were meant to be family entertainment and were always PG. Same with Jurassic Park. But the problem is that PG-13 has been used for movies that WEREN'T supposed to be like this. Terminator was never a family movie. Neither was Robocop. They were always dark, intense sci-fi that people loved because it was hardcore and badass. And look what happened to their PG-13 reboots, they were neither hardcore nor badass. 

The most common justification for things not being R is ""they make less money"" but I think this has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Studios assume they'll make less money, so they make less R rated movies, so they're less likely to make money, so then studios make less, and on and on. 

But adjusted for inflation, [Terminator 2 made almost a BILLION dollars.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=520.000%2C000&year1=1991&year2=2015) (the calculator only goes up to 10,000,000 so I had to knock off some zeroes).  

[The Matrix Reloaded made even more.](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=742.1&year1=2003&year2=2015) 

If it's part of a franchise we like, people will probably see it anyway. It might lose a slight margin but clearly it's possible to still become a huge hit and have an R rating. 

Hell, even if it's something we DON'T know about, it can still make money. Nobody cared about the comic that Kingsman was based on but it made a lot of cash anyway. Just imagine if it had actually been part of a previously established franchise, it could have even made more of a killing. In fact, I bet the next one does even better. 

And Deadpool, who does have a fanbase, is in no way a mainstream hero and was a big gamble. But it's crushing records right now and grossed almost THREE TIMES its meager budget in just a few days. And the only reason it got made to begin with is because of Ryan Reynolds pushing for it and fans demanding it. How many more of these movies could have been made in the past but weren't because of studios not taking risks? Well, THIS risk payed off extremely well. I know Ryan wasn't the only one to make it happen, and I really appreciate whomever made the film a reality, not because it's the best movie ever (it is good though), but because it could represent Hollywood funding more of these kinds of movies. 

Sorry for the rant, but I really hope these movies are indicative of Hollywood returning to form and taking more risks again. This may be linked to /r/moviescirclejerk, but I don't care, I think it needed to be said. 

EDIT: Holy shit, did you people read anything other than the title? I addressed the majority of the points being made here. ",53628,2902,1455482693.0,Discussion,0.83,True,False,MasterLawlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/45sul3/okay_hollywood_deadpool_and_kingsman_the_secret/,top,medium

This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.

movies,eh71gy,I saw 192 movies in theaters in 2019. Here is my full ranking.,"This year I went to see 192 different movies in theaters, plus one rewatch. That's up from 162 in 2018, 140 in 2017, 9 in 2016, and 5 in 2015. I usually go 3 or 4 times per week, mostly on weekends. I keep track of dates/theaters/movies/ratings for fun and save all of the stubs.

My ratings are what I give the movie right after seeing it, with no real 'checklist' or anything, mostly just initial thought/enjoyment/opinion. It's not meant to be taken super seriously, I'm not a professional reviewer.

This is my full ranking for the year, from favorite to least-favorite, with a few small reviews/thoughts thrown in:

--------------------------------------------------------

**Monos - 10/10** - *Hands-down my favorite movie of the year and honestly high on my all-time list. It's Apocalypse Now meets Lord of the Flies, with some Beasts of No Nation thrown in. It builds a unique, lived-in world that's believable and brutal. Beautifully-filmed, some of the best shots of the year (the ending shot gets seared in your mind). Modern and grounded look at a militia/cartel fighting against an unnamed enemy in a Colombian jungle. It almost feels post-apocalyptic instead of 'cartel vs government', which I really loved. You get to imagine your own backstory as the story unfolds. Unforgiving and gut-wrenching, but hopeful too. Got a lot out of its cast. Can't recommend this movie enough. Really disappointed this didn't make the Best Foreign Language Film shortlist. ""Masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but in my mind this is the only one this year.*

**Marriage Story - 10/10**

**The Farewell - 10/10**

**Journey to a Mother's Room - 9/10** - *Biggest surprise of the year, came out of nowhere. Deeply-personal story between a mother & daughter. It's very basic on the surface, and there's not much story (you start at Point A, and end at Point A), but it's the most emotional movie of the year. If you don't cry at least 3 times during this, you're probably not human. It's all about the unbreakable connection you have to your parent(s), from the day you're born until the day you die. It only takes place over the course of a few months, but feels like lifetimes. Beautiful little movie about separation, loss, and human connection.*

**Waves - 9/10** - *I could write 20 pages on how much I loved this movie. To keep it short, it's got a perfect soundtrack, perfect setting, awards-worthy performances (from Kelvin Harrison Jr., Sterling K. Brown, and Taylor Russell). Visceral story that grips you from the first minute and doesn't let go until the closing shot. Unique use of colors and aspect-ratio. It takes a huge risk structurally that pays off. It's also the only movie I went to see twice this year. Really worth it too, picked up on a lot of stuff on the second viewing. Would've went a third time if theaters kept it playing longer. Every tiny decision/action has a huge impact. Just watch this.*

**Last Black Man In San Francisco - 9/10**

**Birds of Passage - 9/10**

**Apollo 11 - 9/10** - *The best documentary of the year. Probably the best editing (and use of sound) I've ever seen/heard in a documentary. It's unique because they don't use interviews like most documentaries do, it's real sound the whole through. Impressive use of archival footage/audio.*

**Uncut Gems - 9/10** - *This movie wasn't on the Best Original Score shortlist for the 2020 Oscars. This aggression will not stand.*

**The Mustang - 9/10**

**Wild Rose - 9/10** - *If this doesn't win the Oscar for Best Original Song ('Glasgow'), I've lost all faith in the Academy. The ending concert scene had me crying like a baby. Jessie Buckley is gonna be big. Best music-drama since A Star Is Born.*

**Transit  - 9/10**

**Ad Astra - 9/10** - *Top-notch acting, great atmosphere, world-building, existentialism, beautiful VFX, engaging score. Best opening scene of the year. Thoughtful commentary on modern society all wrapped in a Heart of Darkness blanket. If you're into space/exploration movies, then I recommend this. Surprised at the backlash this movie has gotten on /r/movies.*

**The Report  - 9/10** - *This was a really good year for legal-thrillers and The Report was the cream of the crop. Tight, Sorkin-like script with top performances from Adam Driver & Annette Bening. Could change a lot of minds about the war on terror and use of torture.*

**Parasite - 9/10**

**Once Upon A Time In Hollywood - 9/10**

**Midnight Traveler - 9/10** - *If you feel like life is unfair and the odds are stacked against you, watch this movie. It puts everything in a different perspective. Every problem you have is going to seem minuscule compared to what this family went through. It's eye-opening and should fill you with anger.*

**Luce - 9/10** - *It's Kelvin Harrison Jr's world and we're just living in it.*

**The Irishman - 8/10**

**Mickey and the Bear - 8/10** - *Camila Morrone puts in the best breakout performance of the year. PTSD, drug-addiction, alcoholism, rural Montana, toxic relationships, James Badge Dale, following your dreams. What's not to love?*

**The Art of Self Defense - 8/10** - *The best dark-comedy of the year. So many great one liners. It's like Yorgos Lanthimos directing Death of Stalin, set in a karate studio. Surprisingly violent and depressing, but in all the right ways. Jesse Eisenberg's best movie since.....The Social Network?*

**Peanut Butter Falcon - 8/10** - *""Am I going to die?"" ""We all do, it's only a 
matter of time, now stop being a little bitch."" - Favorite line of the year, really stuck with me.*

**Everybody Knows - 8/10**

**Mary Magdalene - 8/10**

**Knives Out - 8/10** - *Well-crafted whoddunit with an ensemble cast. Just a genuinely fun time at the movies. Ana de Armas with well-deserved leading role for once. A few of the characters are a tad bit unrealistic (and basically caricatures), but the movie doesn't take itself seriously enough for that to be a problem. Daniel Craig hamming it up with a Southern accent was fun. Old school film with a modern twist.*

**The Lighthouse - 8/10** 

**The Dead Don't Die - 8/10** - *This movie really isn't for everyone, but I loved the dry humor and purposefully-bad chemistry/dialogue. The line delivery was off-putting but hilarious. Everything is extremely on-the-nose and it works. I could watch 10 hours of Tom Waits talking to himself.*

**Us - 8/10**

**Villains - 8/10**

**Ford v Ferrari  - 8/10** 

**Midsommar - 8/10**

**Jojo Rabbit  - 8/10** 

**Official Secrets - 8/10** - *Keira Knightley with one of the most underrated performances of the year. Another really good legal/political-thriller that exposes the dark side of government bureaucracy.*

**Pain & Glory - 8/10** 

**John Wick 3: Parabellum - 8/10**

**Queen & Slim - 8/10**

**Amazing Grace - 8/10** - *Great concert-documentary. Some of Aretha Franklin's performances in this should give you insane chills. I actually had this one rated higher right after watching it, but then looked up some of the people shown on screen and it turns out some were real pieces of shit, while preaching to people like hypocrits. Felt gross and took a lot of the magic out. One of my few revised scores this year.*

**A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood - 8/10**

**Joker - 8/10**

**Non-Fiction - 8/10** - *It's very French (talky and sexual) and the writing seems impressed with itself,  but it's a good adult-drama that surprised me. I'm a big fan of Olivier Assayas and this is some of his best work.*

**Rocketman - 8/10**

**Stan & Ollie - 8/10**

**Hustlers - 8/10**

**Avengers Endgame - 8/10**

**Doctor Sleep - 8/10** - *It gets bloated and probably needed to be 20-30 minutes shorter (there's a shit ton of side-characters), but it was a worthwhile sequel to The Shining. Didn't feel like a cash grab and carries its own weight.*

**Booksmart - 8/10** 

**Little Monsters  - 8/10** - *I'd recommend watching this based just on Josh Gad's character. So over-the-top and hilarious. When he starts chugging hand sanitizer might be the most I laughed in a theater this year. Also Lupita Nyong'o playing & singing on the ukulele to a bunch of kids is exactly what I needed in my life. Cute zombie-comedy with a ton of heart.*

**Spider-Man: Far From Home - 8/10**

**A Hidden Life - 8/10** - *If there's a song from this year (or this decade even) that I'd want played at my funeral, it's James Newton Howard's theme from this movie. It's so beautiful and perfectly captures the feel of the movie. That song broke me down every time it played. I can't imagine this movie without it, it's that good. It's a shame this movie is getting ignored this awards season.*

**Never Look Away - 8/10**

**Toy Story 4 - 8/10**

**Pavarotti - 8/10**

**The Biggest Little Farm - 8/10**-  *If you're really into the inner-workings of a Californian farm, then this is the documentary for you.*

**Abominable - 8/10**  

**The Current War - 7/10** 

**Artic  - 7/10** - *Well made, solidly-acted. I loved the small details about survival that this movie brings up, makes it very grounded and realistic. I'm kinda bored of survival movies in general so this didn't blow my mind or anything.*

**Bombshell - 7/10**

**Honey Boy - 7/10** - *Pretty big letdown because I had really high expectations for this one. Lacked the emotional punch I hoped for. Didn't land for me at all, kind of like Boy Erased last year. I appreciate how honest and revealing it was, took a lot of guts for Shia LaBeouf to put this out there but it's forgettable. Lucas Hedges' Shia impression was reallllly on point though, that was worth the price of admission right there. Mid90s last year was a 10/10 for me and I expected the same for this. It was good, not great.*

**American Woman - 7/10** - *Sienna Miller's performance in this is awards-worthy. The accent she does is perfect and it might be the most underrated role of the year. The movie gets way too tearjerky at the end though. It's basically 2 hours of bad shit happening to a good person, which gets a bit overwhelming.*

**The Beach Bum - 7/10**

**Captain Marvel - 7/10**

**Spies In Disguise - 7/10** - *Looked pretty generic based on the trailer, but was actually pretty funny.*

**Cold Pursuit - 7/10**

**Tolkien - 7/10** - *Not much happens but it felt really comfortable. Solid performances all around and they handled the WW1 scenes better than I thought they would. Expected to be bored out of my mind based on the reviews and trailer but it flowed well. As far as ""Nicholas Hoult Biopics of Famous Writers"" go, it's miles ahead of Rebel in the Rye 2 years ago.*

**Jumanji: The Next Level - 7/10**

**Sauvage/Wild - 7/10**

**Detective Pikachu - 7/10**

**Maiden - 7/10**

**Dark Waters - 7/10** - . *Good performances and an okay script, even though it beats you over the head sometimes. Total waste of Anne Hathaway. She's way too good of an actress for a boring, generic, 'supporting wife' role with just a few lines. Not even sure why she was in this. Overall, a solid legal-thriller, which is a genre I really enjoy and I've been missing since its late-90s heyday. Pretty crazy story too, scummy and evil corporate greed is always interesting to explore on film (like The Insider). Should've been 20 minutes shorter and less on-the-nose*

**Adopt A Highway - 7/10**

**The Wedding Guest - 7/10**

**The Hummingbird Project - 7/10**

**Motherless Brooklyn - 7/10**

**The Lion King - 7/10**

**Last Christmas - 7/10** - *It's really easy to bash this movie, a lot of the humor falls flat and the twist is ridiculous, but I couldn't help walking out with a smile. I love how committed Emilia Clarke was to the character, and her interactions with her boss and family were legitimately heart-warming at times. Also did I mention how ridiculous that twist is?*

**Richard Jewell  - 7/10** - *This was decent. Even though it's clearly Clint Eastwood's personal crusade (and thinly-veiled propaganda piece in some regards) against the FBI & the Spooky Media™, it still told the story effectively/semi-believably. Some of the characters (Hamm/Wilde obviously) were pretty ridiculous caricatures though, was hard to take anything they said seriously, I mean come on. You just roll your eyes at most of what they say. Some of the situations and encounters are too-conveniently set-up but that's easy to overlook. It had very solid performances (Hauser was great, especially when he finally let's his emotion show, in that scene where he kicks the table). Much better than The Mule, and 20x better than 15:17 To Paris.*

**Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker - 7/10**

**21 Bridges - 7/10**

**Before You Know It - 7/10**

**Hobbs & Shaw - 7/10** - *This is peak ""Stupid Summer Popcorn Movie"" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's The Meg of 2019*.

**Fighting With My Family - 7/10**

**Pet Sematary  - 7/10**

**Downton Abbey - 7/10** - *Never saw a single episode of the show before watching the movie, but it still felt familiar/safe to jump right in.*

**Yesterday - 7/10**

**Greta  - 7/10** - *It's a cheesy, predictable, non-scary horror film but I liked it. Sometimes you just need Isabelle Hupert to play a psychopathic serial killer. Felt very old-school, a movie straight out of the 1980s.*

**Judy - 7/10** - *It's the definition of Oscar bait and is emotionally manipulative, especially towards the end, but it does a great job at humanizing a Hollywood legend.*

**Frozen 2  - 7/10**

**Aladdin - 7/10**

**The Souvenir - 7/10**

**Zombieland 2: Double Tap - 7/10** - *Nowhere near as memorable/iconic as the first one, but it still got a bunch of laughs from me (especially the Thomas Middleditch/Luke Wilson scene). Above-average for a comedy-sequel, but I could see this one not aging well*.

**The Two Popes - 6/10** - *Two solid performances but underwhelming overall, too many cheap-looking flashback scenes, not enough Pryce/Hopkins. Reminded me of Can You Ever Forgive Me? last year, depending on the 2 leads to carry a weak movie/premise on their back, to disappointing results. Highly-overrated movie.*

**Ready Or Not - 6/10**

**Anna - 6/10** - *It's basically Red Sparrow but slightly worse*.

**Saint Frances  - 6/10**

**Hotel Mumbai - 6/10** 

**Shazam! - 6/10** - *Low-stakes, formulaic, superhero movie clearly made with strict budget limitations. It hits all the notes you'd expect a movie like this to hit. It was decent.*

**Alita: Battle Angel - 6/10**

**Loro - 6/10** - *One of the more disappointing movies of the year. On paper it sounds amazing, a sprawling biopic of an infamous/corrupt Italian politician/mogul by Paolo Sorrentino who's not that far removed from a masterpiece? Sign me the fuck up. But nah, this was a shallow, surface-level (like my reviews), pointless dull knife of a biopic. Too much shoehorned religious imagery too. Tone is all over the place. It can't decide whether it's serious or funny and gets lost in-between. It looked nice at least. It also wins this year's ""Most Nudity"" award, easily beating the rest of the field.*

**Teen Spirit - 6/10**

**The Upside - 6/10**

**Gloria Bell - 6/10** - *Great performance from Julianne Moore but this just felt like ""Middle-Aged Crisis: The Movie"". Just couldn't connect to it. I imagine the original is a lot better.*

**On The Basis Of Sex - 6/10**

**Stockholm - 6/10**

**Give Me Liberty  - 6/10**  - *This is an example of a movie that has its heart in the right place but bites off a lot more than it can chew. There's a beautiful, emotional story in here somewhere, but it's too muddled with ineffective editing tricks and too many side-stories. It's sweet in some ways and the true-life characters bring a lot of charm, but it didn't do that much for me. A lot of 'year-end' lists have this as one of the most overlooked movies of the year, but I don't see it. Rough editing, bad soundtrack.*

**Child's Play - 6/10**

**Good Boys - 6/10** - *Just watch Booksmart instead*.

**Styx - 6/10**

**Woman at War - 6/10**

**The Lego Movie 2 -  6/10**

**Missing Link - 6/10**

**Long Shot - 6/10** - *The chemistry between Charlize Theron & Seth Rogen was great but the jokes couldn't really match it. It's a unique mix of politics & humor, but fell short of being an actual crowd-pleaser.*

**Echo in the Canyon - 6/10**

**Cyrano, My Love - 6/10**

**Dora the Explorer - 6/10**

**Brittany Runs A Marathon - 6/10**

**IT: Chapter 2 - 6/10** - *Way too long. Felt like a never-ending series of fetch-quests. Good CGI & acting though.*

**Mister America - 6/10**

**Crawl - 6/10**

**Trial By Fire - 6/10** - *Great performances by Laura Dern & Jack O'Connell get overshadowed by an overly-preacy script. It doesn't let the audience make up its own mind.*

**The Third Wife - 6/10**

**Godzilla: King of Monsters - 5/10** - *This needed less humans, more monsters.*

**Glass - 5/10**

**Escape Room - 5/10**

**Terminator: Dark Fate - 5/10**

**Dumbo - 5/10** 

**All Is True - 5/10**

**Brightburn  - 5/10**

**The White Crow - 5/10** - *One of those biopics where the movie doesn't do justice to the story. Reading the Wikipedia page on this guy's life, you'd except an Oscar contender. Instead it was just okay. Watch Cold War instead. It's basically this movie but better.*

**High Life - 5/10** - *Unpleasant.*

**Where'd You Go Bernadette? - 5/10**

**Scary Stories to Tell Dark - 5/10**

**Her Smell - 5/10** - *This movie made me physically nauseous. The tight, claustrophobic, haze-filled shots in the first 2 acts really threw me off. It's temporarily redeemed by a reallllllly good third act and a solid performance from Elisabeth Moss. But then deflated by a terrible final scene.*

**By the Grace of God - 5/10** - *Based on the critical acclaim, director, and subject matter, I walked in expected to be blown away. Basically expected Spotlight, but this movie completely derails at the halfway point. Hard to sit through*.

**Blinded by the Light - 5/10**

**The Best of Enemies - 5/10**

**The Aeronauts - 5/10** - *This is mis-marketed as an intense survival story but it's really just a boring biopic with too many flashbacks.*

**Fall of the American Empire - 5/10**

**Family - 5/10**

**The Goldfinch - 5/10** - *It turns out an unfilmable novel really is unfilmbable, who would've thought? Shoutout to Jeffrey Wright & Finn Wolfhard for actually trying.*

**Angel Has Fallen - 5/10**

**Gemini Man - 5/10** 

**Late Night  - 5/10**

**Black and Blue  - 5/10** 

**Diane - 5/10** - *This was just depression-porn. Sometimes it works (Mungiu/Zvyagintsev), sometimes it doesn't (this movie). It's such a bummer. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Mary Kay Place's performance makes it watchable and engaging sometimes.*

**Destroyer - 5/10**

**How To Train Your Dragon 3 - 5/10**

**Rafiki - 5/10** - *I feel bad for this score because I get that this is a really important/significant movie for African Cinema, but I just couldn't get past the terrible acting, bad (like baaaaaad) dialogue, and lackluster story. Again, pretty big achievement that this got made and reached a global audience, but yeah, in a vacuum, it's undoubtedly a bad movie. Felt like an amateur movie on a shoestring budget.*

**Captive State - 4/10**

**Wild Nights With Emily - 4/10** - *This movie is what happens when someone asks the question ""hey, what if we turned Emily Dickinson's life into an SNL skit?"". I get what they were going for, and Molly Shannon is great, but this was extremely unfunny and probably the longest 84-minute movie I've ever seen.*

**Dark Pheonix - 4/10**

**The Addams Family - 4/10**

**Midway  - 4/10**

**To Dust - 4/10**

**Rojo - 4/10** - *The only memorable thing about this movie is that there was a power outage about 90 minutes in so they comped my ticket and gave me a free drink. So that was cool, I guess.*

**The Kid Who Would Be King - 4/10**

**MIB: International - 4/10**

**The Kid - 4/10** - *There's a 98% chance that this movie is some kind of tax write-off or money laundering scheme. It somehow got 2 big names (Pratt & Hawke), co-starring the son of the producer in his first movie ever. Directed by Vincent D'Onofrio for some reason (???). Was dumped by Lionsgate in a few hundred theaters with 0 marketing/promotion, and flopped hard. It's dated, boring, and unoriginal. Cheesy dialogue. Literally a story that's been told a million times before, usually in much better ways. No reason for this to exist. Chris Pratt has the worst fake-movie-beard of all time in this, that's kinda worth checking out.*

**Ramen Shop - 4/10**

**The Good Liar - 4/10**- *The most convoluted, needlessly-complicated plot of the year. Helen Mirren & Ian McKellen both phone it in (I don't blame them, they were given trash to work with). I hate when movies try to crowbar ""WW2 flashbacks"" into their movies when it's not needed.*

**Climax - 4/10**

**Harriet - 4/10** 

**Lucy in the Sky - 4/10** - *Once or twice a year, a movie comes along that has such a frustrating/stupid/anti-climactic ending it makes me actually angry. This is that movie. Natalie Portman had another movie like that last year (Vox Lux). Hey Noah Hawley, what the fuck?*

**Freaks - 4/10** - *This movie would fit well in the ""Good Idea But Bad Execution"" subreddit.*

**Tel Aviv On Fire - 4/10**

**Ma - 4/10**

**Frankie  -  3/10**

**Stuber - 3/10**

**Serenity - 3/10** - *In a year full of batshit-crazy twists (looking at you, Last Christmas), this easily had the batshit-iest twist. It's something you actually have to experience yourself, and be fully-immersed in it, to appreciate how mind-numblingly crazy it is. How they got A-list talent for this script is a total mystery, but it probably involves of a lot of favors and cocaine. It's almost ""so bad its good"". Almost. I can't wait for the sequel, Free Guy, next year.*

**Maleficent 2: Mistress of Evil - 3/10** - *More genocide than I expected for a live-action Disney fairy tale movie.*

**Donnybrook - 3/10**

**The Photograph - 3/10** - *Zzzzzzzzzz...*

**Charlie's Angels - 3/10**

**Hellboy - 3/10** - *This movie is like that annoying kid in middle school that tries way to hard to be edgy. It's gory and vulgar just for the sake of being gory & vulgar. It reminded me of the Predator reboot last year, had the same kind of dated/forced humor that seems to have no real target audience (except for the aforementioned middle school edgy kid I guess). Bad CGI and a boring villain. iirc it also had a lame sequel-bait ending which I hate.*

**Happy Death Day 2U** - 3/10 - 

**The Sun Is Also A Star** - 3/10 - *It's filmed like a generic music video and has the emotional depth of a puddle.*

**Don't Let Go** - 3/10

**The Invisibles** - 3/10

**Playing with Fire  - 3/10** - *This was just like Mark Wahlberg's Instant Family last year, except that it was worse in every imaginable way. No lie, the end-credits bloopers were by far better than anything else in the movie. It was the only time I even chuckled or felt any type of emotion.*

**Cats - 2/10** - *There's not much more I could say that already hasn't been said. Yes, it was bad. No, it wasn't the worst movie in history. For me, it was just so boring. Forgettable songs (except Beautiful Ghosts), no story/plot, nonsensical ending. Just wanted it to end. Jennifer Hudson just floating into space for no reason, Judi Dench giving me unwarranted lessons about raising cats, Ian McKellen slurping milk from a bowl, Extremely-Hairy-And-Naked-Idris-Elba, Cockroach Genocide, etc. These things all happened and we can't change them, and for us to grow as a society, we need to just move on and learn from our mistakes.*

**Rambo: Last Blood - 2/10**

**The Sound of Silence - 2/10** - *More like The Sound of Boredom, amirite? No but seriously, that's all I got. This movie was the closest I got to falling asleep in my seat this year.*

**Synonyms - 2/10**

**Black Christmas - 2/10** - *Extremely cheesy dialogue, cop-out violence, boring/predictable jump scares, low production value (bad even for a low-end Blumhouse movie), some of the worst one-liners you've ever heard, unrealistic/2D characters. Shitty ending. Wayyyyy too heavy-handed with the message. About as subtle as a flying brick to the forehead. Amateur acting, cutaway for every death, etc etc.*

**After the Wedding - 2/10** - *Overacted, muddled garbage.*

**47 Meters Down Uncaged - 1/10**

**Shaft - 1/10** - *Crude, unfunny, soulless, grating, pointless. There's a million adjectives I could use to describe this reboot, and none of them are positive. This is one I'm surprised I didn't just walk out of. Probably didn't have anything better do do that day.*

**Jexi - 1/10** - *This year's worst movie. It's just the kind of movie that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, like you need to watch something else to get the stink of this one out of your mind. It was just so mean-spirited, from start to finish. Not a single joke landed, you just hated all of the characters. There are no redeeming factors. On the technical side, it was very basic, looked like a cheap music video. No memorable scenes, no good lines of dialogue, no originality in any way. None of the ""cheerful""/""pick-me-up"" moments earn any kind of emotional reaction. If you had a freshman high-school film student remake Her as a shitty comedy, this would be it. The fact that I paid money to see this is something I will never live down.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Other:**

* The longest stretch I went without going to the movies was from July 21st thru August 20th, without a single trip to the movies. Partially due to an out-of-country trip and personal stuff. During this time I ""missed out"" on **The Kitchen**, **The Nightingale**, **Brian Banks**, and **Honeyland**. Mostly caught up to the rest.
* The most theater visits in a one-week span was November 1st thru November 8th, with 8 movies that week.
* The most in one day was 3 movies in theaters on March 15th, 2019 (**Styx**, **To Dust**, and **Captive State**).
* There were 26 double-headers this year (two movies in theaters during the same day, usually back-to-back).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Solid year, not as many surprises as 2018 though. Going to try to break 200 in 2020.

movies,79fvp8,"Watch John Wick 1 & 2. Then watch Constantine. Constantine feels like a sequel in a series where our protagonist, John, develops the ability to fight Hell itself. The continuity is made possible because everyone refers to the character as “John” and treats him with a reserved respect.","This a very cool continuity exercise, one that I accidentally stumbled upon in a search to watch movies with detached heroes doing the “right” thing out of obligation. Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as “John” goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it’s Keanu’s cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity.

movies,ffyvir,Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010s. I watched all of them.,"A couple of weeks ago, I showed my son National Treasure, and the whole time I kept thinking “damn, I really miss Nic Cage”. I knew that he was pretty much in the DTV world for the past 10 years, but I didn’t realize to what level. Turns out that Nicolas Cage made 29 direct-to-video movies in the 2010’s, and almost immediately, I was determined to watch every one of them. So I did. In no particular order:  
  
**The Trust. 7/10.**  
A not half-bad way to start things off. It's a little under-cooked at a brisk 90 minutes, but him and Elijah Wood play well of each other. Cage gives his character some quirky traits in the first half coming across as a likeable guy trying to do something he shouldn't, but quickly turns to full-on bad guy in the second half. There's a good story here but it's never fully realized. We are treated to a Cage Out though in the third act, which is always welcome. 1 down, 28 to go.  
  
**Kill Chain. 8/10.**  
This one was really enjoyable! It's sort-of 3 different stories or vignettes that all come together in the second half, which is where Cage enters the picture. He never Cage's Out, playing pretty restrained the whole time (though there is one moment where he comes close). The writing's a bit ham-fisted, and the characters are pure stereotype, but it's well crafted and a very entertaining 90 minutes. So far so good. With 27 to go, things are looking up!  
  
**The Runner. 5/10.**  
Unfocused and uneventful. It’s well cast and there’s a feeling of “this is a real movie” but it wants to be too many things. There’s a decent movie buried in here, but at a brisk 82 minutes, it’s hard to find. There’s no Cage Rage on display here, instead playing it very understated. It’s quality acting though. Three films into this little odyssey, and so far these are more than just paychecks for him, doing the best he can with what he’s given.  
  
**Rage. 6/10.**  
It’s OK, but it’s sloppy. The whole time I’m wondering why nothing seems to piece together, and it’s ultimately all in service of a shock ending that undermines everything that came before. Once again, Cage is solid in this. He keeps things entertaining where others may have had me checking out. One intense Cage Out, but I expected more based on the title and premise. Nevertheless, we journey forward. 4 down, 25 to go.  
  
**Between Worlds. 10/10.**  
I’m going to be fast and loose with the spoilers on this one. Joe is a down-on-his-luck truck driver who lost his wife and kid to a house fire some years prior. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, Joe is at a gas station pit stop where he finds Julie being choked out by some dude. Joe steps in and knocks him out, much to her dissatisfaction. Why? Because 1 hour prior, her daughter was in a motorcycle accident and is now in a coma, and because of a childhood incident, knows that if she is unconscious she can cross over to “the other side”. So her plan was to have some rando choke her in a rest stop bathroom so she could guide her daughter back to the land of the living. Joe interrupted the process, so he offers to give her a ride to the hospital. Once there, she asks Joe to choke her in the hallway so she can try again to reach her. “Something” goes wrong, and instead, Joe’s dead wife is brought back in the daughters body.  
The next 30 minutes see Joe moving in with Julie and playing house while dead-wife-in-daughter (DWID from this point on) slowly creeps around trying to seduce him. It’s the halfway point when Joe is made aware what is happening, and by extension Julie and the movies 1 other character. They all accept this very easily.  
It’s around this time that we get to a scene where Joe and DWID are fucking, interspersed with a scene where Joe and his wife before she died are also fucking. In both of these scenarios, his wife wants him to read poetry while they fuck. The poetry Joe proceeds to read in both scenes is from a book titled, I shit you not, “Memories by Nicolas Cage”.  
More stuff happens, and at the end of the movie, through various circumstances, Joe is doing a classic Cage scream-cry, one arm hugging a jack-in-the-box that presumably belonged to his daughter, and in the other, he is dousing himself in gasoline. He then lights a cigarette, which of course ignites his entire body, and he smokes in a completely normal manner while his body burns. This all happens while Leader of the Pack is playing, a song that holds absolutely no significance to anything that has come prior.  
Throughout, music that feels directly ripped from Twin Peaks is playing, and the whole atmosphere is begging to feel like David Lynch. Is the kind of movie you would find on Cinemax at 2am on a random Wednesday in 1995. It’s fucking glorious.  
At this particular moment in my life, my greatest fear is that with 24 films to go, I will never again reach these heights.  
  
**Inconceivable. 7/10.**  
It’s your typical nanny-isn’t-who-they-seem-to-be sort of deal, but it’s actually entertaining enough. It’s all pretty rote stuff, but there’s nothing offensively bad here. Cage gets 4th billing, with absolutely nothing to do other than play the can’t-see-what’s-really-going-on husband. He’s still decent at it, but this actually does feel like a paycheck movie for him, given that I can’t find any reason he would have looked at the script and thought he had something interesting he could do.  
  
**The Humanity Bureau. 3/10.**  
Lame, cheap, uninteresting near-future story that doesn’t have anything new to say that hasn’t already been said better in dozens of other movies. Cage is actually asleep at the wheel on this one, just kind of making his way through. In fairness, he isn’t given anything to do. Thus far, these movies have managed pretty decent supporting casts. Here though, it’s pretty much Canadian TV extras. Things are starting to feel rocky with 22 left.  
  
**Outcast. 4/10.**  
Meh. Anakin Skywalker is a 12th Century Knight escorting hunted royalty to safe haven. It’s surprisingly not as cheap as I expected, but it’s a completely unoriginal and boring movie. My only reason for watching, Sir Nicolas, does not even enter the picture until the final 30 minutes. He really hams it up with the old English accent, but he can’t save the movie at this point. Things are gonna need to start turning around soon. Maybe a Between Worlds injection every 3 movies.  
  
**Primal. 6/10.**  
A movie where a Jaguar, a killer and Nicolas Cage are all loose on a boat in the middle of the ocean should not be this dull. It’s no fault of Cage, who hurls some great insults throughout when not chomping on a cigar, and the rest of the cast seems game (except you, Jean Grey), so it really comes down to the film itself, which just doesn’t use its premise to the fullest. The whole thing is visually bland, too. It’s so muted it borders on black and white sometimes.  
I had high hopes going in, but thanks to this little journey of mine, I now know director Nick Powell from yesterday’s Outcast endeavor, and as soon as his name popped up in the opening credits, those hopes came crashing down.  
  
**Running with the Devil. 7/10.**  
Flawed and sloppily made, but still entertaining enough, mostly due to its surprisingly A-list cast that never gets to do much. It's not nearly as cool as it wants to be though. What Feast made a great joke about in its opening few minutes, this movie tries to do for real, to eye rolling effect. Cage is very low-key in this, with Laurence Fishburne of all people having the most fun. His characters sexual proclivities serve no purpose, and an early montage of them would be pointless if he wasn't so much fun to watch. Perhaps the biggest disappointment though is that Nicolas Cage and Adam Goldberg get some screen time together, and rather than take this opportunity to have them out-anxious each other, nothing comes of it. I'm so d-d-d-d-d-disappointed.  
  
**A Score to Settle. 8/10.**  
Went in expecting a typical revenge flick, but was pleasantly surprised to see something more. Cage is really great in this, and I'm more and more impressed by him with each movie. He really disappears into each role, never doing the same thing twice even if he sometimes is playing similar characters. There are a few moments of the Cage Madness here, much in the same way that Christopher Walken or Sam Rockwell try to dance in every movie they do, but the more subdued acting takes center stage.  
  
**The Frozen Ground. 8/10.**  
Tight cat-and-mouse type that focuses on the procedural more than the thriller aspect and is better for it. Cage is in top form, and Cusack ain't half bad either. Might I want to dip my toe into his DTV output next? Perhaps. 17 to go first.
  
**211. 1/10.**  
Jesus Fucking Christ.  
  
**Dying of the Light. 6/10.**  
**Dark. 7/10.**  
As it exists in its official form, it’s a middling CIA thriller with an intriguing Cage performance being the most interesting part.  
In it’s “Director’s Cut”, which is even less of an actual movie than Donner’s Superman II, everything is much more intriguing, and had Schrader been able to make an actual final cut, this could have had the potential to be great.
The concept of a dying CIA agent spending his last days trying to catch a dying terrorist is a solid one, but it isn’t fully realized in either version as is. Cage’s performance is a little manic in both, but more fleshed out and sympathetic in the later. CIA business aside, I’d have liked to watch 90 minutes of Cage just losing his mind. Actually that movie could be 3 hours long and still not be enough.  
  
**Stolen. 9/10.**  
A cheap Taken knock-off crossed with a heist movie that’s a stupid amount of fun. Josh Lucas is gloriously unhinged here, out Cage-ing the man himself. Can the remaining 14 keep up?  
  
**Arsenal. 5/10.**  
DTV mediocrity that tries too hard to be cool. Cage is hamming it up in a small-ish role, and certainly makes his scenes entertaining, but the rest of the DTV-All-Stars are bland.  
  
**Seeking Justice. 8/10.**  
It’s packaged as a revenge thriller, but it’s much more in line with 13 Sins/The Game/Nerve. The whole thing is pretty ridiculous, but it’s a lot of fun to watch. It doesn’t use its New Orleans setting as well as Stolen, but the two would make for a hell of a double feature.  
  
**Dog Eat Dog. 7/10.**  
Weird movie, but compellingly so. Shrader gets his editing jollies off that he couldn’t do on Dying of the Light, but I’m not sure it does much to add to a movie that is otherwise a pretty simple tale of low-level criminals wanting to hit it big. Cage and Dafoe is a great pairing, but it’s never fully utilized, outside of an odd, half-naked condiment fight.  
  
**Vengeance: A Love Story. ?/10.**  
After the first 10 minutes, where you can fill a card 100% while playing Cop Trope Bingo, you get the deformed child of two very different movies. In the first movie you have a fairly dark, if poorly constructed, movie about the aftermath of an assault and rape where any one aspect of which could have been explored, but instead the writer and director give us a Whitman's Sampler of plot threads with none of them fleshed out beyond the initial idea. Nicolas Cage is not in this movie.  
In the second movie however, Nicolas Cage stars in what I can only think to describe of as City of Angels 2. After tragically losing his dear Maggie to that damn logging truck, Seth moves out of LA and assumes the identity of John Drormoor, becoming a policeman who years later becomes involved in the lives of a mother and daughter in the aftermath of a violent attack. After what is obviously Seth/John trying to communicate with Cassiel at the edge of a waterfall for guidance, he is given a much warranted promotion from Angel to Avenging Angel, serving due justice to the duos attackers.  
These two movies have been edited together. I don't know how to give this a numbered rating. There are 10 remaining.  
  
**USS Indianapolis: Men of Courage. 3/10.**  
A poorly made movie that plays like a work of complete fiction. The use of a famous quote 50 years before it was coined is particularly atrocious, as is Tom Sizemore, acting as though he were Tobias Fünke trying his best at an Academy Award.
This is the first straight-up bad movie thus far. Up until this point they’ve either crossed over into so-bad-they’re-good or Cage has given a performance that keeps things entertaining and watchable. USS Indianapolis is just a lame movie across the board.  
  
**Joe. 7/10.**  
A solid movie with a really great performance by Cage, but I found its most engaging storyline sidelined by too many others that make the movie feel really long. There is no fun to be had here, and little worth revisiting down the road.  
  
**Color Out of Space. 8/10.**  
Delivered what I was hoping for on most accounts, but continues to prove that adapting Lovecraft, especially on a low budget, is very difficult. There are some real horrors on display though proving that practical effects are still king, and Cage is great, showing again his talent and desire to really put his all into every role.  
  
**Grand Isle. 6/10.**  
A came cast keeps things going for the first hour, which is essentially a single location play, but it all starts to fall apart in the third act. Grammer has about 10 minutes of collective screen time and only 30 seconds of those shared with Cage. KaDee Strickland is the most surprising here, matching Cage's enthusiasm and keeping the whole thing very entertaining, but it ultimately amounts to very little. The low-budget also doesn't help, constantly referencing a hurricane that is never seen. A shame really, cause you can see the potential for something greater here.  
  
**Looking Glass. 5/10.**  
A thriller without thrills, trying so hard to be mysterious and failing at each try. Cage is given nothing to do but walk around and look confused for 100 minutes. Things rarely happen, and when they do they make no sense by the end. There's a solid first act setup with some cool ideas, and every single one is wasted. I was hoping for something along the lines of 8MM, but this was not that.  
The final 5 remain.  
  
**Mom and Dad. 8/10.**  
A deranged concept which Cage is perfectly suited for, but like my issue with Nicholson in The Shining, he’s already a little crazy before he goes crazy. I love the tone set with the opening credits, but Taylor goes to frenetic too quickly, never letting us settle in before cranking things up to 11.  
All that aside, it’s a totally bonkers movie and watching Cage let loose is always 100% entertainment. As a whole it just lacks the finesse to bump this up to top tier.  
  
**Trespass. 8/10.**  
There’s more than a few stupid character decisions, and I don’t love the way the flashback structure is done, but the performances across the board are really good, and the intensity level is consistent throughout.  
  
**Pay the Ghost. 7/10.**  
A pretty decent spookfest that creates a moody atmosphere and some chilling imagery. While “Color Out of Space” falls in the horror genre, and Cage has done more than a few thrillers, this is the only actual scary movie he’s ever done. I’d like to see more.  
  
**Army of One. 4/10.**  
Cage sounds like he’s doing a Rain Man impression the entire time, and the movie is narrated in a Wake Up, Ron Burgundy style which is just awful. A very unfunny movie that is more annoying than anything else.  
  
**Mandy. 10/10.**  
There was no better way to end this journey. Cage is smartly restrained for a majority of the picture, but when the beast is let loose, THE BEAST IS LET LOOSE! A fever dream of a movie that delivers on all accounts, and something that will be re-watched in years to come.

EDIT: In order to keep the title streamlined I said ""direct-to-video"". Perhaps what I should have said was ""movies that did not have a nationwide theatrical release"".

EDIT 2: You are all incredibly kind! I very much enjoyed this, and it only furthered my appreciation for Nic Cage. He currently has 4 movies in post-production, and I’m eager to watch each one of them. To answer a common question, each movie was reviewed on its own merits, and not on any sort of curve or in-comparison to another movie.

EDIT 3: How did I watch them? [The right way.](https://imgur.com/a/qYIKxUW)

movies,k6ze6l,My 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. [SPOILERS],"Last year, I introduced him to Die Hard and I said it was one of my favorite Christmas movies. All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story. And he's 100% right; Lethal Weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of August. Christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. 

So I pointed out that Gruber's gang in Die Hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime Christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the FBI out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. 

You take Xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. 

And again, McClane is in that building specifically because it's Christmas. 

No Christmas, no Die Hard. 

He's not happy about it. 

So tomorrow we're going to have to watch Love Actually and see what he thinks.",48280,2724,1607135857.0,,0.79,True,False,gynoceros,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/k6ze6l/my_12_year_old_is_pissed_at_me_because_he/,top,medium

movies,aul7km,Disney lost the Best Animated Film for the first time since 2006,"After Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse won Best Animated Film last night, it got me thinking about how it seemed like finally an animated film not made by Disney or Pixar won that category. So I went and looked it up and sure enough, Disney/Pixar has won the Oscar in this category every single year they had a movie up for nomination, since 2006 (in 2011, they didn’t have a movie up for nomination AND YES, as everyone keeps asking in the comment section: Rango won this year. Disney did not have a movie nominated, and Rango won, and no, Rango is not a Disney movie). In 2006, they lost the Oscar to Happy Feet (the Disney movie up for nomination was Cars).

As much of a Disney movie lover as I am, I’m so glad that the Academy didn’t just blindly hand over the award to Disney again, but actually chose the best of the bunch. And I’m so glad it’s Into The Spider-Verse. This movie deserves it.

Edit: to all those confused about Marvel’s role in this movie, u/Viceprezbacon has a great comment below summarizing the relationships:
“To all confused about Disney and Spiderman. Sony owns the rights to spiderman. The Marvel attributed with being involved with this movie is the comic book company. Disney was in no way involved with this movie. They own Marvel Studios, who produce the live action movies and have no affiliation with Sony in this regard (outside the spiderman deal).”",47943,3238,1551101031.0,,0.9,True,False,just-_here-_to-_lurk,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/aul7km/disney_lost_the_best_animated_film_for_the_first/,top,medium

OH FUCK WHY THE FUCK IS THE TRAILER FOR 'ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK' FUCKING UP MY SHIT!?!?!?!?!?!?""

Seriously, STOP FUCKING DOING THAT.  I KNOW YOUR SHOWS FUCKING EXIST.  LET ME HAVE AT LEAST A COUPLE OF MINUTES OF COMEDOWN BEFORE SHOVELING YOUR NEXT SERIES IN MY GODDAMN FACE ALREADY"".

I mean, shit, if even there was a button that said ""let me watch the end credits"" I'd be OK with it, but NOPE THERE'S FUCKING NOTHING.

Netflix, you had our backs five years ago, and now you're just as fucking bad as anyone else.  LISTEN TO ME, STOP THIS SHIT.

(((( MEGA EDIT ))))

 Well... holy smokes, le blow up... and some of you have no sense of humour.  A few comments.

a) I don't hate Netflix in general.  People saying ""just stop paying for it"" are being ridiculous.  I even get that a lot of people *like* the autoplay feature, which is great.  I just don't like that it's *automatic* and there's no option to turn it off (for me, at least).

b) I think for some reason you guys have options when you watch that I don't.  None of your suggestions work for me, or seem available.  Probably depends how you're watching Netflix.  I'm using a Sony smart TV.  Maybe I truly am ""retarded"", as some of you insist.  But I don't have the settings menu ya'll are talking about, that's for sure.

c) I'm howling at the comments about ""entitlement"".  Uh, what?  I'm paying for a service here, not asking for my student loans to be cleared.  If we don't like something we're paying for, we're ""entitled"" so say something about it.

d) As for the ""don't get so excited"" posts.  Well, firstly, alcohol.  Secondly, obviously the issue isn't that big of a deal, that's why the obviously over the top response.  I dunno, I thought it was funny.  Certainly didn't think anyone would care about it.  What's really interesting is how pissed off people get that I even posted it in the first place.  Oh, sorry, let's get back to how exciting that fifth poster is for (insert 483rd Marvel sequel here).

e) Some of you don't sit through the credits.  That's cool, but some of us (apparently a *lot* of us) do.  

f) If you've never gotten to the end of a film and felt the need to sit there and think about it for a bit... that's... really sad.

g) Weirdly, the thing that set me off was *Blue Thunder*.  I loved this movie as a kid, loved the shitty electronic score... so when I got the end I'm like ""oh yeah, there's this extendo version of the theme which was pretty sweet"" and then I get there and BOOM it's like NO MUSIC ONLY TRAILER.

movies,eckx4x,'Cats' - Review Thread,"Review embargo just lifted for *Cats*. Apparently it's purr-ty bad. This is getting **absolutely destroyed** by critics. Some of these reviews are legit ""worst of the year"" contenders. Lots of savage (and hilarious) 1/10 or 2/10 reviews. This movie just went from Oscar-hopeful to Razzies-favorite. It's a total trainwreck.

On the bright side, there will at least be some award-winning puns/memes to come out of this. Looks like the trailer backlash was warranted after all.

[The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/cats-film-review-musical-movie-2019-taylor-swift/) 

> Andrew Lloyd Webber’s feline fantasy musical becomes a garish hairball. It’s hard to “ruin” Webber’s already strange musical, but Tom Hooper’s wrongheaded attempt certainly tries. Tom Hooper’s jarring fever dream of a spectacle is like something that escaped from Dr. Moreau’s creature laboratory instead of a poet’s and a composer’s feline (uni)verse, an un-catty valley hybrid of physical and digital that unsettles and crashes way more often than it enchants. 

[Bleeding Cool](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2019/12/18/cats-review-a-bad-musical-adapted-into-a-worse-movie/)

[Slant](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review-tom-hoopers-cats-is-a-chaotic-tribute-to-a-dire-cultural-artifact/)

> This adaptation gets straight to the heart of the material, which is basically two hours of stray cats introducing themselves.

[Rendy Reviews](https://www.rendyreviews.com/movies//cats-review)

> On a scale of one to Zemeckis, Hooper's Cats boldly goes beyond the uncanny valley and creates a tier of its own.

Screen Junkies

> A spectacular disaster...This movie feels like a prank but I don't know on whom.

[The Jam Report](https://thejamreport.com/2019/12/19/review-cats-is-the-most-inexplicably-bizarre-film-of-the-year/)

[RTE Ireland](https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/movie-reviews/2019/1218/1101984-cats-is-a-twee-and-irksome-furrago-of-a-movie/)

> First off, full disclosure - I am not a cat person. Second off - after watching this frankly mortifying film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats, I'm not altogether sure I am a movie person anymore either.

movies,wq5308,"""Passengers"" with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt is one of the most transparently ""wish fulfillment"" movies I've seen","It's borderline Wattpad material. 

Have you ever fantasized about being stuck on an island with Jennifer Lawrence but don't want to worry about pesky little things like scavenging for food and supplies or basic survival? Well, say no more, because here you'll be trapped in an automated, luxurious space cruise with Jennifer Lawrence. Your every need will be met by helpful, sassy British bartenders and you'll live out your days in languorous comfort.

You won't have to worry about any competition for J-Law's attention, of course, because everyone else in the cruise will be conveniently asleep in their cryo chambers. Except for the hottest woman, whom you woke up in a moment of ~~horniness~~ weakness that the movie will bend over backwards to justify (more on that later). 

But worry not, you'll get to keep your status as a relatable, salt-of-the-earth, blue collar everyday guy and still partake of the ship's luxurious priviliges because J-Law will use *her* VIP bracelet to procure the best food and accommodations for you, cheap ticket holder. Whew! That was close!

And then, eventually, of course, J-Law will find out you woke her up and basically doomed her to a slow death with nobody else but you by her side and prevented her from fulfilling her life-long dream of being the first journalist to set foot on humanity's newly-colonized planet. BUT, before she can get *too* angry about a simple faux pas like that, Laurence Fishburne will make a timely appearance and with his Old Man Wisdom and in his dying breath (we don't want ol' Laurence staying for too long and stealing your girl, right?), he will tell J-Law to forgive you because you need to stay together, for...reasons, even though he doesn't know any of you.

And if that wasn't enough to make J-Law forget you murdered her and ruined her life, there's a sudden mechanical problem that threatens the lives of everyone onboard and only you with your humble, mechanical prowess can fix it, heroically risking your life in the process. 

But you'll survive of course, and you'll save the day so hard that J-Law will not only forgive you but she'll fall in love with you so completely that she'll refuse to use the surplus cryo chamber and instead choose to spend the rest of her life wandering around an empty ship with you, because women don't need those silly professional goals, they just need a man to make them happy.

Not only have they starred in some of the strangest films to date but their involvement has often helped secure funding for independent directors who might otherwise struggle to find the money. Elijah Wood even runs his own production company to help up and coming directors get their weird and wonderful ideas to the big screen.

movies,kxb3f6,The transformation of Rambo from broken veteran to unstoppable killing machine is a real cultural loss.,"There really isn’t a more idiotic devolution of a character in modern popular culture than that of Rambo. If you haven’t seen the first film, First Blood, it’s a quite cynical and anti-military movie. Rambo isn’t a psychotic nationalist, he’s a broken machine. He was made to be an indestructible soldier by an uncaring military at the cost of his humanity. He’s a character so good at violence it scares him, and the only person he actually kills in the first film is both in self defense and largely on accident. It’s not even an action film, it’s a drama about veterans who cannot re-enter society after a meaningless war. The climax of the film isn’t Rambo killing, but sobbing about how horrifying his experiences were.

Then, in the second film, we get a neck shattering 180 into full on Ronald Reagan revisionism of the war in Vietnam. Rambo 2 perpetuates several popular and resilient myths about the Vietnam War, such as that American POWs were still there after the war and that the war would have been won by Americans of only we (the American people) had allowed them to win.

To say Rambo 2 is cultural vandalism would be putting it mildly. It’s a cinematic tragedy. They took a poignant anti war film and made it into a jingoistic Cold War fantasy.",46129,2555,1610647710.0,Discussion,0.88,True,False,HasSomeSelfEsteem,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kxb3f6/the_transformation_of_rambo_from_broken_veteran/,top,medium
